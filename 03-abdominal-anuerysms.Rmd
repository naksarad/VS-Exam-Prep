## Pathogenesis, presentation and risk factors

**What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   Defined as a localized dilation of an artery to a diameter greater
    than 50% (1.5x) of its normal diameter. It is generally accepted
    that \>3cm in adults is considered aneurysmal for the abdominal
    aorta.

-   AAAs can be described as:

    -   Infrarenal -- distal to the renal arteries with normal aorta
        between the renal arteries and the aneurysm origin.

    -   Juxtarenal -- aneurysm extends to the renal arteries but does
        not involve them

    -   Pararenal -- aneurysm involving the origin of at least one of
        the renal arteries

-   Estimated 1.1 million Americans have AAAs, which equates to a
    prevalence of 1.4% in 50-84 year old general population.

    -   Men 65-75y with a history of smoking have a prevalence of 6-7% -
        hence the need for screening.[@lefevre2014; @chaikof2018]

    -   Men without a history of smoking have a prevalence of 2%.

    -   Women who are current smokers 2%, and women with a history of
        smoking 0.8%.[@wanhainen2006]

-   AAAs are 3-7x more prevalent than thoracic aortic aneurysms and can
    co-exist with other aneurysms throughout the arterial vascular
    system like popliteal artery aneurysms.

    -   In a 10-year review originating from Ireland, 50% of patients
        that presented with unilateral popliteal artery aneurysms had
        associated AAA. In patients with bilateral popliteal aneurysms,
        63% of those had associated AAA.
        [@duffyPoplitealAneurysms10year1998]

    -   Patients with femoral aneurysms have an 85% chance of an
        associated AAA. [@diwanIncidenceFemoralPopliteal2000]

    -   Conversely, if a patient is first found to have a AAA, there is
        an 11% chance of having associated popliteal artery aneurysms
        \>15mm. [@tuvesonPatientsAbdominalAortic2016]

    -   Another study showed a rate of femoral-popliteal aneurysms in
        AAA patients is approximately 14%.
        [@diwanIncidenceFemoralPopliteal2000]

    -   This association stresses the importance of a good physical exam
        when evaluating a patient with a AAA and is commonly tested on
        exams.[@chaikof2018; @diwan2000]

**What is the pathogenesis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   More than 90% of AAAs are associated with atherosclerosis.

-   Other causes include cystic medial necrosis, dissection, Marfan's
    syndrome, Ehler's-Danlos syndrome, HIV and syphilis.

-   Elastin and collagen are the major structural proteins responsible
    for the integrity of the aortic wall and defects in these cause
    degeneration and further aneurysmal change.

-   For example, a mutation in fibrillin in Marfan's syndrome causes
    elastin fragmentation and pathological remodeling of the wall of the
    artery to form cystic medial degeneration.

-   Several investigations have also shown that upregulations of
    metalloproteinase activity, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, have an
    essential role in aneurysm formation. Imbalances between aortic wall
    proteases and antiproteases cause degradation of the extracellular
    matrix and loss of structural integrity of the aortic wall.

    -   Nicotine increases MMP expression in vascular smooth muscle
        cells.[@li2012; @rabkin2016]

-   Increased thrombus burden is associated with wall thinning, medial
    loss of smooth muscle cells, elastin degradation, adventitial
    inflammation and aortic wall hypoxia which all increase the rate of
    AAA growth.

    -   Of note, intraluminal thrombus rarely embolizes and is not an
        indication for anticoagulation.[@singh2019; @cameron2018]

-   Infective aortitis is a rare but highly morbid cause for aortic
    aneurysm formation. Treatment in this setting should be more
    aggressive with the addition of antibiotic therapy and open surgical
    repair with rifampin soaked graft whenever feasible.[@gornik2008;
    @paravastu2009; @rasmussen1997]

-   For more about aortitis, see \@ref(large-vasculitis).

**What are the risk factors for AAA occurrence and growth?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   Risk factors for AAAs are similar to the risk factors for occlusive
    atherosclerosis and include age, tobacco use, hypertension, male
    gender and hypercholesterolemia.

-   It has been found that diabetes is protective for AAA progression
    and rupture.

-   Cigarette smoking is the single most important modifiable risk
    factor to prevent occurrence and growth of AAAs. Smoking increases
    the rate of growth by 35% for abdominal aortic aneurysms.

    -   Smoking has a dose dependent relationship with AAA, smoking 1/2
        ppd has one third the risk of smoking 1 ppd.[@kent2010]

-   Medical therapy has been studied with disappointing results.
    Beta-blockers and ACE/ARB inhibitors have been studied but have not
    shown any effect on growth of AAAs.

-   Men more likely to have AAA, but women develop at a later age with
    more aggressive growth and risk for rupture.
    [@loAbdominalAorticAneurysms2016]

    -   Stronger association with smoking in women.

    -   Women have same outcomes from endo repair, higher complications
        from open repair due to poorly managemend CV risk factors.

-   Fluoroquinolones[@lee2015; @lee2018; @lemaire2018; @pasternak2018]

    -   In a recent study just published in JAMA Surgery this January,
        the group at UNC showed an increased short-term risk of
        developing an aortic aneurysm with fluoroquinolone use.
        [@newtonAssociationFluoroquinoloneUse2021a]

    -   They reviewed all prescription fills for fluoroquinolones or
        comparative antibiotics from 2005-2017.

    -   This included \>27 million US Adults aged 18-64 years old with
        no history of aneurysms.

    -   18% of the prescriptions were fluoroquinolones.

    -   Fluoroquinolones were associated with increased incidence of
        aortic aneurysms. Compared to the other antibiotics,
        fluoroquinolones were associated with a higher 90-day incidence
        of AAA and iliac aneurysms as well as more likely to undergo
        aneurysm repair.

    -   They recommended that fluoroquinolone use should be pursued with
        caution in all adults, not just high risk individuals, and they
        recommended broadening of the warnings from the FDA.

-   Fluoroquinolones playing a role in dissections and aneurysm
    formation is often a highly tested question

**What is the dreaded complication of AAA?**

-   Aneurysm rupture is the fear with a diagnosis of AAA. The risk of
    rupture increases yearly as the aneurysm expands. Once an aneurysm
    develops, it tends to enlarge gradually yet progressively. This is
    an important concept to grasp for testing.[@lindsay2019; @tracci]

-   Growth rate

    -   For smaller aneurysms (3-5cm in size), the growth rate is
        approximately 2-3mm/year

    -   For larger aneurysms (\>5cm), the growth rate is higher at
        3-5mm/year.

-   Rupture risk, historically, has been described as:

| AAA Size | Cumulative Annual Rupture Risk |
|:--------:|:------------------------------:|
| 3-3.9 cm |              0.3%              |
| 4-4.9 cm |            0.5-1.5%            |
| 5-5.9 cm |             1-11%              |
| 6-6.9 cm |             11-22%             |
|  \>7 cm  |             \>30%              |

: Historical reporting of AAA rupture risk[@tracci]

-   Newer data suggests the true rupture risk per year is decreasing
    with time. Rupture risk has recently been reported to be much lower.

    -   A systematic review from the UK published in JVS in 2015, the
        rupture risks were far lower than previously reported and what
        is documented in most textbooks. Data included 11 studies,
        reviewing 1514 patients, published between 1995 and
        2014.[@parkinsonRuptureRatesUntreated2015]

|  AAA Size  |          Cumulative Annual Rupture Risk           |
|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
|  \<5.5 cm  |            \<1%[@oliver-williams2019]             |
| 5.5-6.0 cm | 3.5% [0-9%][@parkinsonRuptureRatesUntreated2015]  |
| 6.1-7.0 cm | 4.1% [0-9%][@parkinsonRuptureRatesUntreated2015]  |
|  \>7.0 cm  | 6.3% [0-14%][@parkinsonRuptureRatesUntreated2015] |

: AAA rupture risk based on most recent publications

-   Factors that increase the risk of rupture other than the size of the
    aneurysm are smoking, COPD, hypertension, transplant recipient, and
    rapid enlargement (defined as 1 cm/year or more).

## Evaluation and Diagnosis

**What is the work up for a AAA?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   75% of all infrarenal AAAs are asymptomatic when first detected and
    often incidentally discovered on unrelated imaging.

-   Symptoms - Some patients may report symptoms such as abdominal,
    flank or back pain from pressure on adjacent somatic sensory nerves
    or overlying peritoneum. Tenderness by itself is not a reliable
    indicator of impending rupture. Other symptoms include thrombosis
    and distal embolization.

### Imaging

-   Ultrasound, when feasible, is the preferred imaging modality for
    aneurysm screening and surveillance.

    -   The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends a one-time
        ultrasound screening in men and women ages 65 to 75 years with
        either a history of smoking or a family history of AAA, as well
        as men and women over the age of 75 with a smoking history in
        otherwise good health who have not previously undergone
        screening. [@chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a]
    -   For more technical details on duplex screening see \@ref(aorta).

| Size on Imaging | Surveillance Interval |
|:---------------:|:---------------------:|
|  2.5 -- 2.9 cm  |       10 years        |
|   3 - 3.9 cm    |        3 years        |
|   4 - 4.9 cm    |        1 year         |
|    5 - 5.4cm    |       6 months        |

: Recommended Intervals for AAA Surveillance[@thompson2013;
@chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a]

-   It is important to note that these screening guidelines are Level 2,
    Grade C evidence from the SVS.

-   Traditionally, once duplex reveals an aneurysm 5cm in size, an
    initial CTA is performed and patients are followed with additional
    CT scans to assist with operative planning.

-   CT Angiograms are helpful in operative planning and determining
    candidacy for EVAR. You can assess the relationship of the aneurysm
    to the renal arteries, assess the access vessels, and measure seal
    zones

    -   The maximum aneurysm diameter derived from the CTA should be
        based on outer wall to outer wall measurement perpendicular to
        the path of the aorta (the centerline of the aneurysm).

-   MRA is recommended for patients with renal insufficiency who cannot
    tolerate iodinated contrast.

## Management

**What are the indications for repair?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   The current recommendation to repair a fusiform aneurysm is 5.5cm
    for men (Level 1, Grade A evidence), 5.0cm for women as they have a
    higher risk for rupture, and rapid growth (\>5mm over 6 months).
    [@chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a]

-   For saccular aneurysms, the SVS practice guidelines recommend
    elective repair (Level 2, Grade C evidence).
    [@chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a]

    -   Studies show equivalent wall stress in saccular aneurysms at
        much smaller sizes when compared to fusiform aneurysms. This has
        led to the notion that they have a higher rupture risk at
        smaller sizes.

    -   A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery in 2016 showed a
        significant portion of ruptures \<55mm in size were saccular in
        nature. [@kristmundssonMorphologySmallAbdominal2016]

        -   Specific size guidelines for repair are currently lacking
            because of their infrequent presentation.

**What are the options for repair, and how do you choose?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019;
@fairman72AortoiliacAneurysms2019]

-   Two options: open repair and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
    (EVAR).

    -   When attempting to decide between the two, one must consider the
        patient's perioperative risk as well as the patient's anatomy,
        which will be reviewed further here.

-   When reviewing the patient's risk for surgery, there are many tools
    to assist, which are outlined in the Society for Vascular Surgery's
    practice guidelines.

-   The VSGNE or Vascular Study Group of New England developed a risk
    prediction model for mortality which can assist in your decision
    making. This is endorsed by both SVS and the Vascular Quality
    Initiative.[@chaikof2018; @eslami2015]

    -   This risk model looks at open vs endovascular repair and further
        delineates infrarenal vs suprarenal clamps

    -   It includes aneurysm sizes with 6.5cm as the cut off.

    -   It includes age above or below 75yo.

    -   Gender and comorbidities are included like heart disease,
        cerebrovascular disease and COPD.

    -   An important risk factor is also renal function which is
        delineated by creatinine at 1.5-2 or \>2.

    -   Each of these risk factors is assigned a point grading.

    -   These points are added together and they place the patient on a
        spectrum of mortality risk. Depending on the amount of points
        accumulated, the risk is divided into low, medium, high or
        prohibitively high-risk groups

    -   This is something that can help both the patient and physician
        in deciding on surgery and how to proceed.

-   Recent studies have shown that decreased aerobic fitness and high
    frailty score predicted increased morbidity and mortality after open
    aneurysm repair.

-   High-risk patients are defined by the following in the SVS
    guidelines:

    -   Unstable angina or angina at rest

    -   Congestive heart failure with EF \< 25-30%

    -   Serum creatinine level \> 3 mg/dL

    -   Pulmonary disease manifested by room air PaO2 \< 50 mmHg,
        elevated PCO2, or both.

-   To help delineate a patient's risk, a preoperative workup is
    necessary. The SVS practice guidelines recommend the following:
    [@chaikofSocietyVascularSurgery2018a]

    -   Determine if the patient has an active cardiovascular condition.
        Coronary artery disease is responsible for at least 50% to 60%
        of perioperative and late deaths after operations on the
        abdominal aorta, therefore, it is important for patients to
        undergo cardiac evaluation prior to surgery.

        -   Unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, severe
            valvular disease, significant arrythmia -\> Cardiology
            consultation (Level 1, Grade B)

        -   Significant clinical risk factors such as coronary artery
            disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes
            mellitus, and chronic kidney disease -\> Stress test (Level
            2, Grade B)

        -   Worsening dyspnea -\> Echocardiogram (Level 1, Grade A)

        -   All patients undergoing EVAR or open repair require EKG

        -   In patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as
            climbing two flights of stairs or running a short distance
            (MET \>= 4), there is no benefit in further testing.

        -   If coronary intervention is required, this takes precedence
            over aneurysm repair.

    -   History of COPD

        -   Pulmonary function test with ABG (Level 2, Grade C)

        -   Smoking cessation for at least 2 weeks prior (Level 1, Grade

            C)  

        -   Pulmonary bronchodilators at least 2 weeks before aneurysm
            repair (Level 2, Grade C)

-   In patients who are deemed high risk, EVAR is the most attractive
    option in anatomically suitable patients

-   Morbidity and mortality rates are lower for EVAR than open repair in
    the short term. This is illustrated in multiple studies.

    -   The EVAR-1 trial, a randomized prospective UK study including
        1082 patients, compared EVAR with open AAA repair in patients
        who were fit enough to undergo open surgical repair from
        1999-2003. The 30-day mortality rate was reduced in the EVAR
        group (1.7% vs 4.7%), although secondary interventions were more
        common in the EVAR group (9.8% vs. 5.8%).
        [@greenhalghComparisonEndovascularAneurysm2004]

    -   The DREAM trial, a multicenter randomized trial from 2000-2003,
        compared open repair with EVAR in 345 patients with a reduction
        in operative mortality (4.7% vs 9.8%) with the majority of
        complications accounted for by pulmonary issues.
        [@prinssenRandomizedTrialComparing2004]

-   This early survival benefit with EVAR over open repair disappears by
    the third postoperative year.

    -   The Open vs Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial included 881
        patients from 42 VA centers randomized to either EVAR or open
        repair. This demonstrated that perioperative mortality was
        improved in the EVAR group (0.5% vs 3.0%), yet no statistically
        significant difference was seen in mortality at 2 years (7.0% vs
        9.8%). [@lederleOpenEndovascularRepair2019]

    -   Late mortality seems to be higher in EVAR due to ruptures from
        endoleaks that do not occur in open repair.
        [@rajendranLateRuptureAbdominal2017]

-   Reviewing the anatomic criteria for traditional EVAR may rule out
    EVAR as an option in some patients. These criteria vary slightly
    depending on the particular device being used.

    -   Neck

        -   A neck length of at least 10-15mm from the renal arteries to
            the aneurysm start with a diameter of 18-32mm.

        -   It is important that the neck is relatively free of thrombus
            or calcification to decrease the risk of endoleaks.

        -   Infrarenal necks 4-15mm would require fenestrated
            endovascular repair. The only FDA approved device for
            fenestrated repairs is the Cook Z-Fen
            device.[@oderichResultsUnitedStates2014]

            -   Z-fen requires diameter 19-31mm, angle \<45deg angle to
                long axis of aneurysm, ipsilateral iliac fixation \>30mm
                and 9-21mm in diam, contralateral iliac \>30mm and
                7-21mm diam. Multiple or early branching renal arteries
                can limit this reapir as well.
                [@oderichTechnicalAspectsRepair2014]

            -   Parallel grafts for short necks (i.e. snorkel or
                chimney) require 20mm seal for good outcomes.
                [@donasCollectedWorldExperience2015]

    -   Angulation

        -   Neck angulation should be \< 60 degrees for current devices

    -   Access vessels

        -   Access vessels must be adequate for delivery of the device
            depending on the sheath size required (6-8mm)

    -   Aortic bifurcation

        -   The aortic bifurcation must be \>20mm in size to accommodate
            the graft opening to full caliber

    -   Iliac landing zone

        -   Adequate seal zone in the distal common iliac arteries of
            10-15mm in length and diameter of 7.5-25mm.

        -   If covering the hypogastric arteries is necessary
            unilaterally to obtain a seal, you can embolize the
            hypogastric artery (to prevent retrograde flow) and extend
            the graft into the external iliac artery.

        -   If this is an issue bilaterally, an iliac branch device can
            assist in maintaining perfusion into the hypogastric
            arteries.

Special considerations

-   Aortocaval fistula - sometimes aneurysms can be complicated by
    fistula with the IVC. This can occur with primary fistula, rupture
    and after repair. This is rare, 1% in elective AAA and 6% in
    rupture.[@brightwell2013; @schmidt1994] High risk of persistent
    endoleak due to ongoing flow into IVC. Open repair often
    best.[@orion2016]

### EVAR

**Can you briefly go over the steps of an EVAR?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   EVAR now accounts for approximately 70-80% of elective abdominal
    aortic aneurysm repairs and 65% of iliac aneurysm repairs in the
    United States and many other countries.

-   Performed in the operating room or IR suite with a fixed or portable
    C-arm

-   Anesthesia

    -   Regional block, local anesthesia or general anesthesia depending
        on surgeon preference and patient risk

-   Groin access and short sheath placement

    -   Percutaneous - Closure devices are introduced prior to inserting
        the large sheaths containing the stent-grafts

    -   Cut-down

-   Pigtail catheter is used to perform an aortogram of the abdominal
    aorta and iliac arteries

-   The renal artery orifices are marked. If there is any concern about
    good visualization, IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) can be used to
    assist.

-   Systemic heparin is given

-   Bilateral femoral sheaths are exchanged over a stiff wire for the
    necessary sheaths required for the device size chosen.

    -   Main trunk and ipsilateral limb sheath on one side

    -   Contralateral limb sheath on the other side

-   The main body is positioned in the proximal neck and a repeat
    angiogram is commonly performed to confirm the positioning of the
    device at the desired level just below the lowest renal artery. It
    is best to position the main body so that the gate is directed at
    the simplest angle to cannulate.

-   The main body is deployed to the point where the gate is opened

-   Contralateral limb gate cannulation is performed using a wire and
    directional catheter.

-   Once in the gate, a pigtail catheter is formed within the main body
    and must be able to spin freely 360 degrees to confirm placement
    within the endograft

-   The contralateral limb is introduced and deployed taking care to
    preserve flow to the internal iliac artery.

-   The remainder of the main body is deployed and iliac extensions
    deployed if required.

-   The stent graft is ballooned at the neck, within the gate, at the
    bifurcation, and distal iliac seal zones.

-   An aortogram, usually multiple in different views, is performed to
    exclude any endoleaks.

-   The sheaths are removed, and the groin sites are closed using
    Perclose devices if performed percutaneously, or primary repair if
    open cutdown performed.

-   Check pedal signals at the end of the case to ensure no
    thromboembolic events or femoral artery access injuries have
    occurred. If there is concern, an ultrasound duplex can be performed
    intraoperatively.

**You mentioned endoleaks, can you discuss the complications specific to
EVAR and the management?** [@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   15 year follow up from EVAR-1 shows inferior late survival and
    higher re-intervention in EVAR patients when compared with open
    repair. [@patelEndovascularOpenRepair2016]

-   Many of the cardiopulmonary complications inherent with open repair
    do not occur with EVAR as there is no aortic cross clamping.

    -   In a study from Mayo clinic evaluating elective infrarenal AAA
        repairs from 1999 to 2001, Elkouri et al found that cardiac and
        pulmonary morbidity after EVAR was drastically reduced compared
        to open repair (11% vs 22% and 3% vs 16%, respectively).
        [@elkouriPerioperativeComplicationsEarly2004]

-   Risk of ischemic colitis remains as the IMA is covered with EVAR. It
    is lower than with open repair but remains 1-2%.

-   Renal insufficiency may occur secondary to contrast administration
    in a patient with underlying chronic kidney disease. Thromboembolic
    events may occur from thrombus-laden aortic necks with wire and
    device manipulation to the renal arteries as well.

-   Iliac limb occlusion - can occur within hours of EVAR (3-5%). Risk
    factors included iliac artery tortuosity, calcified plaque burden or
    occlusive disease, external iliac artery dissection[@vacirca2019],
    inadequate outflow due to access site complication. Post operative
    CFA duplex will show dampened waveforms.[@greenhalgh2010;
    @taudorf2014]

-   Emergent conversion from EVAR to open are associated with
    significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Risk factors
    include aneurysm diameter, young age, female gender and nonwhite
    race.[@ultee2016]

#### Endoleaks

Defined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac following EVAR.

1.  Type I

    -   A leak at the graft ends secondary to inadequate seal proximally
        (1a) or distally (1b)

    -   If identified intraoperatively, Type I endoleaks require
        attention with further balloon angioplasty, proximal or distal
        extension, or endoanchors.

        -   Use of endoanchors in thrombus and calcium-laden aorta is
            not recommended.[@jordan2014] Outcomes are similar with or
            without suprarenal fixation.

    -   If seen in follow up surveillance, intervention is necessary.

2.  Type II

    -   Sac filling secondary to retrograde filling via a branch vessel
        off of the aneurysm sac such as a lumbar artery or the IMA

    -   If identified intraoperatively, this typically does not need to
        be addressed in the OR. Typically, type II endoleaks
        spontaneously thrombose and therefore can be observed.

    -   It is common to continue monitoring even if there is persistent
        flow as long as there is no aneurysm sac growth. Type II
        endoleaks persist in 5-25% of patients. Risk factors for
        persistent endoleak include anticoagulation[@bobadilla2010],
        patency/number/diameter of IMA/lumbar arteries[@ward2014],
        hypogastric coil embolization, distal graft extension, absence
        of COPD, age \>80yrs, and graft type. Risk of rupture is
        1.5-3%.[@lo2016; @abularrage2010; @timaran2004; @shalaby2016;
        @sarac2012; @jones2007]

    -   If the leak persists for \> 6 months with sac enlargement \>5mm,
        intervention is recommended. Several techniques exist to
        eliminate type II endoleaks, most frequently embolization. After
        multiple attempts at repair and if continued sac growth with
        impending Type I leak, then consider open
        conversion.[@kelso2009; @mohapatra2019]

3.  Type III

    -   Separation of graft components

    -   Usually identified in follow-up surveillance and necessitates
        intervention.

4.  Type IV

    -   Secondary to a porous graft which typically does not occur any
        longer as endograft material and devices have improved. If seen,
        no intervention is needed at the time, and they usually
        thrombose on their own.

5.  Type V

    -   Increasing aneurysm sac size with no identifiable endoleak.
        Commonly referred to as endotension.

    -   Usually necessitates graft explantation and open repair or
        re-lining of the graft.

### Open Repair

**Now we can move onto open repair. Describe an open infrarenal aneurysm
repair.** [@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019;
@garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013]

-   After thorough preoperative evaluation and clearance, the patient is
    taken back to the operating room. An epidural may be placed
    preoperatively depending on institutional preference. The patient is
    intubated, and arterial and central venous catheters are placed. The
    abdomen is prepped from chest to bilateral thighs.

-   A cell-saver should be available to optimize resuscitation during
    the procedure due to expected large amounts of blood loss. Balanced
    resuscitation to prevent coagulopathy is important with significant
    blood loss.

-   Exposure

    -   Trans-peritoneal or retro-peritoneal. First we will describe the
        most common approach: trans-peritoneal.

-   Surgical steps

    1.  Mid-line laparotomy, transverse or chevron-style incision

    2.  A retractor system such as an Omni, Bookwalter or Balfour
        retractor is used to assist in exposure depending on physician
        preference.

    3.  The transverse colon is retracted cephalad, and the small bowel
        is retracted to the patient's right to expose the aorta. The
        duodenum is mobilized and the ligament of Treitz is divided. The
        posterior peritoneum is opened along the anterior wall of the
        aorta.

    4.  The aneurysm sac is now in view and careful dissection
        proximally for clamp site is achieved. Identification of the
        left renal vein crossing the aorta is key and can be divided if
        necessary.

    5.  Identification of the renal arteries proximally is required if
        there is a plan for suprarenal clamping.

    6.  Isolate bilateral common iliac arteries for distal clamp site.
        Use caution when dissecting the fibro-areolar tissue overlying
        the left common iliac artery as it contains nerves that control
        sexual function. Damage can result in retrograde ejaculation.

        -   You can avoid nerve injury with mobilization of the sigmoid
            colon medially and identifying the iliac bifurcation
            distally, thus avoiding transecting the tissue overlying the
            left common iliac artery.

        -   If the iliac arteries are severely calcified and pose risk
            for injury with clamping, intraluminal balloon catheters can
            be inserted for distal control instead.

        -   Also, you must be cognizant of the location of the ureters
            crossing over the iliac bifurcation to prevent injury.

    7.  After proximal and distal clamp sites have been identified,
        systemic heparin is administered by anesthesia.

    8.  Clamp the distal vessels first to prevent distal embolization.

    9.  Open the aneurysm sac in a longitudinal fashion toward the
        patient's right to avoid the IMA and clear the sac of thrombus.
        Extend proximally to normal aorta and then t off the incision on
        the aortic wall.

        -   Some physicians prefer to transect the aortic wall as
            opposed to leaving the posterior wall intact for the
            anastomosis.

    10. Lumbar arteries on the posterior wall are ligated using
        figure-of-eight sutures.

        -   Back-bleeding lumbar vessels can be the source of
            significant blood loss.

    11. Graft

        -   A tube graft or bifurcated graft depending on the patient's
            anatomy and aortic diameter is chosen. Dacron or PTFE grafts
            are most common, and the choice depends on physician
            preference. This is anastomosed proximally in a continuous
            fashion.

        -   Once complete, the graft is flushed forward to flush out any
            thrombus. The graft is then clamped and the aortic clamp
            removed to test the anastomosis. Repair if needed.

        -   The distal anastomosis is completed to the aorta or
            bilateral iliac arteries depending on extent of the
            aneurysm.

        -   The graft is flushed forward prior to completion to remove
            any thrombus within the graft. The anastomosis is completed
            and clamps removed.

    12. Hypotension may occur at this point from re-perfusion of the
        lower extremities and pelvis. Anesthesia should be notified that
        unclamping will occur soon prior to completion of the distal
        anastomosis to allow for fluid resuscitation in preparation.

        -   The graft can be slowly unclamped or partially clamped to
            assist with blood pressure management during this time. You
            can also place manual pressure on the iliac arteries or
            femoral arteries to slowly release flow and avoid
            significant hypotension.

    13. Next, the IMA must be addressed. The IMA orifice is identified
        within the aneurysm sac.

        -   Chronically occluded or pulsatile back bleeding -\> ligate.

        -   Anything between occlusion and strong pulsatile back
            bleeding requires further evaluation. This should be
            performed at the end of the case after the internal iliacs
            have been reperfused. Methods to measure perfusion:

            -   Place vessel loops or micro bulldog on IMA and assess
                the sigmoid colon. If there is a poor doppler signal on
                the antimesenteric border of the sigmoid colon, the IMA
                should be reimplanted.

            -   Insert blunt-tip needle through the IMA orifice and pull
                vessel loop around needle to secure and connect to a
                transducer. Pressure less than 35 mmHg requires
                reimplantation. [@hoballahInferiorMesentericArtery2021]

        -   The Carrel patch technique involves excising a circular
            button of the aortic wall around the IMA and anastomosing it
            to the graft wall.

        -   Newer studies have shown that IMA reimplantation does not
            eliminate the risk of ischemic colitis after open AAA
            repair. In a study out of George Washington University in DC
            published in JVS in 2019, there was still significant risk
            of ischemic colitis rates with IMA reimplantation.
            [@leeInferiorMesentericArtery2019]

            -   Using NSQIP data collected prospectively and studied
                retrospectively

            -   Out of 2397 patients undergoing AAA from 2012-2015, 135
                patients (5.6%) had ischemic colitis.

            -   672 patients were evaluated further after exclusion
                criteria applied (suprarenal clamp, emergent or
                ruptured, occluded mesenteric vessels)

            -   Of these, 637 patients had IMA ligation, 35 had IMA
                reimplantation

            -   Reimplantation was associated with - More frequent
                return to the OR (20% vs 7.2%), Higher rates of wound
                complications (17.1% vs 3%), Higher rates of ischemic
                colitis (8.6% vs 2.4%)

        -   Difficult to interpret impact of revascularization of IMA on
            ischemic colitis rates, due to selection bias, but should be
            noted that patients who require revascularization still may
            experience colon ischemia.

    14. To finish, the aneurysm sac is then closed over the graft to
        protect the viscera, and the retro-peritoneum is reapproximated.
        Occasionally, a vascularized omental pedicle flap may be used to
        separate the graft from the duodenum to prevent an aorto-enteric
        fistula if the peritoneum cannot be closed securely.

-   Steps for the retro-peritoneal approach:

    -   Positioned semi-lateral with the left side up with bilateral
        groins exposed for femoral artery access. This is done in a lazy
        lateral position where the patients upper body is near complete
        lateral but the hips are rotated to the patient's left in
        attempt to keep both groins in the field in case they need to be
        accessed.

    -   An oblique incision extends from the left 11th intercostal space
        or tip of the 12th rib to the edge of the rectus abdominus
        muscle, through the external and internal oblique muscles,
        transversalis fascia until you are just superficial to the
        peritoneum. Using blunt finger dissection, the peritoneum is
        dissected from the abdominal wall posteriorly over the psoas
        muscle until the aorta is reached.

        -   Benefits include less postoperative ileus, less
            intraoperative hypothermia, lower IV fluid requirements, and
            less post-op respiratory compromise.

        -   A disadvantage is the difficulty addressing the right iliac
            artery from this approach.

#### Complications

**What are some of the complications with open aortic aneurysm repair?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   Recent studies have demonstrated equivalent outcomes in younger
    healthy patients undergoing endovascular and open repair.
    [@liangComparablePerioperativeMortality2018]

-   Myocardial dysfunction which is usually secondary to cardiac
    ischemia or hemorrhage.

    -   Acute conditions associated with poor post-operative cardiac
        outcomes include recent MI (30d), unstable angina, decompensated
        heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, severe valvular
        disease.[@devereaux2015; @fleisher2014; @kristensen2014;
        @tashiro2014]

-   Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to coagulopathic bleeding
    postoperatively or third spacing of fluids can cause abdominal
    compartment syndrome requiring emergent laparotomy.[@cheatham2007;
    @mehta2005; @rasmussen1997]

    -   Signs include unexplained oliguria, difficulty maintaining
        adequate ventilation--elevated peak inspiratory pressure, and
        hypotension with significant abdominal distension is concerning
        for abdominal compartment syndrome. A sustained bladder pressure
        \> 25 mmHg with associated organ dysfunction (elevated peak
        airway pressures, new onset acute renal failure) is indicative
        of abdominal compartment syndrome.

    -   Abdominal compartment syndrome can still occur after EVAR during
        an aortic rupture in up to 10-20% of patients, therefore, one
        must keep a heightened suspicion for this in the post-operative
        period.[@veith2009]

    -   It is important to note that a patient with a soft abdominal
        exam can still have abdominal compartment syndrome particularly
        with an enlarged body habitus.

    -   Laparotomy may initially worsen hypotension and hemodynamic
        instability due to reperfusion injury.

-   Renal failure can occur due to suprarenal aortic clamping,
    atheromatous embolization or hypotension causing acute tubular
    necrosis (ATN).

-   Postoperative ileus is common. Duodenal obstruction from dissection
    of the ligament of Treitz can mimic a gastric outlet obstruction.

-   Ischemic colitis of the left colon and rectum is the most serious
    gastrointestinal complication.[@moghadamyeghaneh2016]

    -   Incidence ranges from 0.2 - 10%, 3-4x more common after
        operations for occlusive disease than aneurysmal disease.

    -   It is important to study the collateral pathways on the
        preoperative CT scan and the patient's history to assist in
        surgical decisions regarding IMA reimplantation including:

        -   Stenosis/occlusion of the SMA

        -   Previous colectomy

        -   IMA or Hypogastric artery occlusion

    -   Earliest manifestation is postoperative diarrhea, especially
        bloody diarrhea.

    -   Sigmoidoscopy is needed for diagnosis.

        -   Mild colon ischemia with patchy mucosal involvement should
            be treated with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and
            antibiotics. Transmural necrosis requires emergent operation
            with colon resection. Patients can be left in discontinuity
            or an end colostomy performed depending on stability.

        -   The mortality rate with colon ischemia after aneurysm
            surgery is about 25% but reaches over 50% if bowel resection
            is required.[@brewsterIntestinalIschemiaComplicating1991]
            This is a very heavily tested topic for both general surgery
            and vascular surgery boards.

-   Distal ischemia from embolization downstream can lodge in larger
    vessels or cause microembolization, colloquially known as "trash
    foot".

-   Infection is rare but can be associated with graft-enteric fistula
    which is another highly tested topic.[@fatima2013; @oderich2011;
    @smeds2016]

#### Postoperative Surveillance

**What is the post-operative surveillance required for open and
endovascular approach, and how do they differ?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019]

-   That is a great question because it highlights why open repair has
    continued to be so important, especially for young, healthy
    patients.

-   Post-operative surveillance is necessary in the immediate
    post-operative period for open repair to evaluate incisions.
    Follow-up is only needed every 5-10 years, unless the patient
    becomes symptomatic.

    -   Peri-anastomotic degeneration occurs in 0.5-10% of cases. Can be
        diagnosed with CT scan or ultrasound.\@curl1992

-   In contrast, EVAR patients require a strict postoperative
    surveillance regimen to allow for detection of endoleaks, aneurysm
    sac expansion, stent fracture, limb kinking and material fatigue.

    -   CT scans at 1-, 6- and 12-month intervals initially then
        annually are recommended which raises concerns related to cost,
        cumulative radiation exposure, and contrast administration.

    -   Some physicians may elect to use ultrasound for surveillance
        with CTA prompted if an endoleak is identified or the sac is
        enlarged, particularly in patients with stable aneurysms.

    -   The long-term follow-up is often inconsistent and a study of
        19,962 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR from 2001 to 2008
        showed that 50% of patients were lost to annual imaging
        follow-up at 5 years after
        surgery.[@schanzerFollowUpComplianceEndovascular2015]

-   Some patients will elect for open repair to avoid frequent
    surveillance if they are a candidate for both, while other patients
    will select endovascular management to avoid the short-term effects
    like longer hospitalizations, post-operative pain, and longer
    recovery time to baseline functioning in open surgery.

### Ruptured Aneurysms

**Although elective repair is important, can you touch on the management
of a ruptured AAA (RAAA) as our last topic of the session?**
[@mooreVascularEndovascularSurgery2019; @lindsayChapter74Ruptured2019]

-   Ruptured AAAs have declined secondary to improved medical
    management, decreased rates of smoking and superior diagnostic
    imaging and surveillance.

-   Traditionally, it has been taught that 50% of ruptured AAAs die in
    the field and of those remaining, 50% will die in the hospital. With
    time, the in-hospital mortality rate has decreased.

    -   In one study out of Finland, of 712 patients with ruptured AAAs
        from 2003-2013, 52% died prior to arrival to the hospital. Of
        those that were offered surgery, 67% of patients were alive at
        30 days indicating a mortality rate of 33%.
        [@lainePopulationbasedStudyRuptured2016]

-   Diagnostic triad on presentation:

    -   Pain, syncope and known or palpable AAA.

-   When a ruptured AAA is suspected or diagnosed, permissive
    hypotension is key in the initial management before surgery.

    -   Allowing systolic arterial pressures of 50-70 mmHg as long as
        the patient is mentating appropriately.

    -   Limits internal bleeding which further limits loss of platelets
        and clotting factors.

-   Initial management involves many considerations like patient
    stability, patient's anatomy and the surgeon's experience with
    either open or endovascular repair.

-   Due to the developments of endovascular techniques, it is ideal to
    have a CTA prior to the operating room to determine if the patient
    is a candidate for an EVAR.

-   There are two options for expedient aortic control in an unstable
    patient with a ruptured aneurysm.

    -   Open supraceliac aortic clamping

        -   Achieved by retracting the stomach caudally, entering and
            dividing a portion of the gastrohepatic ligament, reaching
            under and medial to the caudate lobe, dividing the pars
            flaccida, and identifying the spine. The aorta lies to the
            patient's left of the spine and is bluntly dissected
            anteriorly and laterally for aortic clamp placement.

        -   Another method of supraceliac exposure and control is to
            mobilize and reflect the left lobe of the liver, sweep the
            esophagus to the patient's left, divide the right crus of
            the diaphragm and bluntly dissect both sides of the aorta
            then apply the clamp.

        -   A nasogastric tube can help identify the esophagus when
            placing this clamp to ensure the esophagus has been swept to
            the patient's left and protected.

        -   The clamp should be moved down to the desired position for
            repair (supra or infrarenal depending on anatomy of the
            aneurysm neck) to decrease ischemia time to visceral vessels
            as soon as possible.

    -   Percutaneous occlusive aortic balloon

        -   Gain percutaneous access and place an occlusive aortic
            balloon for stabilization in the distal thoracic aorta. This
            will require a long support sheath, usually 12fr in size, to
            prevent distal migration of the occlusive balloon.

-   EVAR has been used increasingly to treat ruptured AAAs and offers
    many theoretical advantages over open repair.

-   Less invasive, eliminates risk of damage to periaortic and abdominal
    structures, decreases bleeding from surgical dissection, minimizes
    hypothermia and third space losses, and lessens the requirement for
    deep anesthesia.

-   EVAR has been deemed superior to open repair for the treatment of
    RAAA in many studies.

    -   In a study out of UVA published in JVS in August 2020, they
        looked at ruptures in the VQI database from 2003-2018. This
        resulted in 724 pairs of open and endovascular pairs after
        propensity matching. [@wangEndovascularRepairRuptured2020a]

        -   There was a clear advantage of endovascular compared to open
            repair in patient's with suitable anatomy.

        -   Length of stay was decreased with 5 vs 10 days in open. 30
            day mortality was much lower at 18% vs 32%. Major adverse
            events like MI, Renal failure, leg ischemia, mesenteric
            ischemia, respiratory complications were much lower in the
            EVAR group at 35% vs 68% in the open group.

        -   All cause 1 year survival was much higher with EVAR at 73%
            vs 59% in the open group.

-   Despite improved RAAA results with EVAR, conversion from EVAR to
    open AAA repair appears to have the most unfavorable outcomes in
    terms of mortality.

    -   Conversions can be early or late and are due to access-related
        problems, errors in endograft deployment, graft migration,
        persistent endoleak, graft thrombosis, or infection.

    -   In a study evaluating 32,164 patients from NSQIP with 300
        conversions (7,188 standard open repairs and 24,676 EVARs),
        conversion to open repair was associated with a significantly
        higher 30-day mortality than standard open repair (10% vs 4.2%)
        and EVAR (10% vs 1.7%). In addition, conversion patients
        compared to standard open patients were more likely to undergo
        new dialysis (6.0% vs. 3.5%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation
        (5.3% vs. 1.9%), postoperative blood transfusion (42.3% vs.
        31.6%), and have a myocardial infarction (5.0% vs. 2.2%).
        [@ulteeConversionEVAROpen2016]

    -   A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis found the
        elective late open conversion has comparable outcomes to primary
        open aneurysm repair. 36% are able to complete with infrarenal
        clamp alone. Highest complication rate in urgent setting (10x
        higher mortality).

## Iliac/Peripheral Aneurysms

### Demographics

CIAA aneurysm defined as \>1.5cm.

### Presentation

Often found incidentally, but carries risk of rupture and distal
embolization.

-   Distal embolization is rare, but when it occurs patient should
    undergo embolectomy and treatment of aneurysm thought to be the
    embolic source.[@bacharach2008; @ferreira2010; @nachbur1991]

### Management

Treatment threshold for CIAA is often accepted at 3.5cm.[@dix2005;
@laine2017]

Treatment options include

-   Open repair

    -   If open repair involves aneurysm or occlusive disease of
        internal iliac arteries, should attempt to revascularize at
        least one IIA via a jump graft.[@krupski1998; @huang2008]

-   Iliac branched device to preserve hypogastric. Minimum size
    requirements include:

    -   CIA 17mm in diameter

    -   EIA 6.5-25mm in diameter, 10mm seal zone

    -   IIA 6.5-13.5mm in diameter, 10mm seal zone[@schneider2017]

-   Extension of EVAR into external iliac and coil of internal iliac
    artery

    -   If internal iliac arteries also aneurysmal, ensure that outflow
        vessels are all coiled. Posterior branch gives rise to the
        superior gluteal artery, which is high risk for retrograde
        filling.[@ryer2012]

    -   Coil embolization can result in ipsilateral buttock claudication
        in 12-22% of patients. Treatment is with medical therapy and
        walking regimen, resolution usually occurs at 6
        months.[@papazoglou2012; @stokmans2013]

    -   If the IMA is chronically occluded, then coverage of the IIA may
        compromise colonic blood flow and increase risk of
        ischemia.[@angiletta2011; @karch2000]
