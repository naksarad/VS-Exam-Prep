<p><strong>Kevin:</strong></p>
<p>Okay and welcome back to the behind the knife and audible bleeding vascular trauma podcast series with our guest Dr. Todd Rasmussen Dr. Rasmussen is a Colonel in the United States air force and is a professor of surgery and associate Dean of research at the uniform services university of health sciences in intending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed military medical center thank you Dr. Rasmussen for coming back on a joint podcast to help us learn about trauma</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sure it’s a pleasure and I look forward to some of our discussion Thank you</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We’re lucky enough to have one of my partners dr OD Hum A L muesli He’s a chief resident at Cornell and he’ll be helping us with this interview Thanks Adam</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Thank you I’m happy to nerd out about some surgical technique Was a master here</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So We’re going to drive straight into abdominal venous injuries and we’re going to keep it simple here When we’re thinking of abdominal venous injuries we’re gonna think of three types You have your IVC you have your portal vein and you have her superior mesenteric vein So we’re going to break these down in order and discuss the approaches to exposing it and fixing it So of these doctor recipes and what what do you see most commonly</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> that’s a great question is to which we see most commonly I think they’re all relatively uncommon because of the frequency of blunt trauma especially in the civilian setting I suspect that blunt liver injury and the relationship between the liver and vena cava</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> In our isolated injuries to the the IBC is there any non operative management that’s a minimal for the IVC</p>
<p>so I think yeah I think there’s a number of types of injuries Scenarios would be amenable to non operative management we just mentioned very briefly the retro Paddick cable injuries in fact most of the time if the patient and be stable and doesn’t have other associated injuries that require exploring that area of the vena cava Oftentimes retro hepatic vena cave injury should be managed non-operative And that’s of course the difficult nature of exposing that area of the of the VTK VA and the high risk of causing more bleeding with with that exposure because of the venous system the vena cable has a low pressure system infer renal vena cava injuries super Reno vena cave injuries or even super paddock can be well tolerated the nonoperative management cause it’s a low low pressure system but in particular the retro retro Paddick a portion I think is</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> But you kind of touched on this a little bit but when when we talk about diversity We sort of divided into four segments anatomically because each of them has their own implications and difficulties The infer renal segment the super renal segment and then the retro paddock and through prophetic segments or the vena cava I think it’s probably worth going through each of those segments And Discussing briefly exposure and I think we should spend some more time on retro hepatic but discussing exposure and then strategies for repair versus ligation and their implications in each of these segments</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Okay Yeah So I guess we’ll start with the infer renal segment of the vena cava It’s probably the most easy to expose this the infer renal Being a cable segment is best approached through a right visceral rotation meaning of bringing the right colon the and the viscera up cephalad in the retroperitoneal space to expose well to expose the vena cave in the infernal segment And That maneuver at its proximal most extent will will expose the the renal veins the fourth portion of the Dudina and the pancreatic head so that’s that’s the best way to expose that and then I think repair options there it depends upon the severity of the injury if it is A partial injury to the vena cava then hopefully primary repair you know the vena cave is quite large it has a large capacity and controlling that and and and and repairing an injured segment primarily with with a four O proline a suture example is pretty well tolerated If one feels like they’re going to narrow the vena cava significantly than that’s a different Consideration which includes then should the BTK would just be like as opposed to trying to repair the vena Cavan and leave it narrowed which then would predispose it to a thrombosis and potentially a life-threatening thromboembolism So that’s sort of this infer renal segment I mean the I mean we could talk an hour on this segment in the vena cava Controlling is challenging because there’s it bleeds black blood and in large quantities and oftentimes controlling proximately distance is not enough because there are lumbar vessels the lumbar veins that are back behind that if you know one doesn’t control one of the large lumbar vessels that’s coming into the vena cava Posterially you can have all the proximal and distal control that you want and you still can’t see anything because you’ve missed a huge lumbar vessel That’s you know lumbar vein that’s feeding from the backside so one has to be mindful of that and try to either identify that and get it with with a clamp of some sort or get around it with a vessel loop or something to control it as we have said in other of our discussions none of these operations or these techniques take place in isolation and they’ve gotta be done in close communication with anesthesia and assure that anesthesia is not only Adhering to the principles of damage control resuscitation with you but they’re also aware of these maneuvers whether it’s losing large volumes of black blood from the vena cava or maybe like gating the vena cave and the infernal segment which is going to significantly reduce the inflow to the right heart</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> So two followup questions on the infer renal cable in general you said you use a O pulling to repair the Kiva Do you ever Pacific needle Probably a larger needle is better And then the second question is when you’re doing and for renal cable ligation do you think we should be empirically doing a four compartment Fasciotomy is on these patients</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So really good point about the needle size So I think a four O on an sh needle is imperative So these are the subtle parts that I think before someone tackles this needs to have in mind Generally you need to barge for suckers You know you’ve got to have headlights and extra set of hands because you know you may only have one or two shots at this you know controlling it and seeing where the bleeding’s coming from And and to the best you can don’t waste one of those opportunities cause what you’re going to be able to do is control it with for example sponge or even your hand so you know while you’ve got a controlled then make sure you’ve got the right lights the right suction devices the right assistance blood in the room you know all of those things Take a deep breath and get all that squared away To your point of a needle the point here that we’re talking about for your listeners is don’t use too small of a needle a common mistake is a this has gotta be a dainty needle It’s gotta be small because there’s sewing on the BTK BA may be a Five-O or you know six O proline and I’ll put it on an RB one or C one needle These are small needles and what happens is that needle You can’t see it in all of the blood So an sh needle is really designed with a sort of a large arc that really can literally go underneath your finger and a four O proline will go on an sh needle So absolutely as far as the empiric performance of four compartment fash autonomies with ligation of the Munich kava I’m going to take a pass on that and say it depends I think it depends upon how much resuscitation the patients received meaning if they’ve received large volumes of fluid they’re physiologically not well and you know you anticipate large sort of significant recovery burden then Yes I would probably do of fasciotomy is of the lower extremities and elevate those legs and do everything you can to keep the pressure down In contrast if the patient’s physiologically pretty well that was a relatively small resuscitation then you know perhaps not I think it it just depends but you should be definitely mindful of it there’s no doubt And and if you don’t do the fast shot dummies recognize that she got to keep an eye on the leg and the legs elevator</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So a doctor asked me he and I have to thank you we actually kind of talked about managing IVC injuries in our first episode So there’s this is our third episode total We’ve covered lower extremity injuries We’ve covered abdominal aortic vascular trauma in today’s our Venus But on our first episode we talked about using the large FORO needle and about a week after that episode we got called into a internal hemipelvectomy case which I didn’t even know it was a case where the orthopedic surgeons were resecting this massive sarcoma off the pelvis and basically resecting half of the pelvis and they got into massive bleeding Basically they had gotten into the crotch of the IVC and had just extenuating hemorrhage near move their hands and using the large Mauro needle The large needle in the Fort with is really helpful A because like you said it how did you see it through all the bleeding And then the thing is nice about the FORO is you can really kind of crank down on it and and push You’re not down there without worrying about it breaking And when you’re in a in this case with lots of bleeding and there’s five people around the operating table I found it really helpful so when we were in that case</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Good</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> You mentioned in your book chapter which I also have seen in some liver cases were injuries So that gave are made That’s helpful is when you’re placing these sutures into the vena cava if you’re doing a figure of eight or a figure of 16 placing the first suture and then lifting on both of those strands of the suture up in the air to elevate the hole</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah that’s a an important part And I think you know I would go back to the fact that you you know you’re only gonna get one or two maybe three chances at this So you know don’t skive I mean don’t be afraid to take too big a bite I mean you gotta get substance of the vessel and you got to get the bleeding control or you’re just not going to to get to the next step So yeah So making that first pass that you think well this can be a figure vein it’s a little bit blind It’s not completely I’m not advocating for taking hail Mary you know I’m not saying that but But the point is be definitive about your suture placement and and go ahead and get full thickness by to the vessel wall then pull up on that and and that may help you expose you know each each injury is a little bit different but try to recognize that in order to get through it to that next step you’re going to have to get a false full thickness bites of of even the vein you know and it in fact especially the vein right Because it’s going to be more prone to tear So you really can’t skimp on</p>
<p>And so once you go above the renal veins the kind of the ability to to Leggett completely changes and everywhere above that So can we talk a little bit about the anatomy of the super renal and then just briefly discuss retro paddock and super hepatic IVC</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So I guess we didn’t really mention But the reason that the infer renal ligation can be tolerated it’s not ideal but it patients will survive with ligating The Infor renal is because one has not disrupted the The venous outflow of the kidneys so with an infer renal ligation flow through the left and right renal veins is maintained and therefore kidney function is still preserved that has you referenced changes when the injury is above the renal veins in the super renal segment of the IBC and in those cases you’re right ligation really isn’t an option You know this is a very small segment as only a two or three centimeter segment of the IVC you know between the superior aspect of the renal vein and then the initiation of the drainage of the paddock veins you know the retro paddock So this is a very small segment and you know I think that if there’s an injury in this segment it should be you know attempts should be made to primarily repair it if if you find yourself operating on it this also gets in this area where It really could also be almost considered retro Padick and certainly if these are blunt injuries or from a blunt mechanism you may not want to find yourself operating on that if the patient will give you that option</p>
<p>so if you do find yourself needing to operate on this obviously you you need to mobilize the liver to expose this part of the of the vena cava what considerations do you need to take into account before mobilizing the liver And can you walk us through your technique in doing so</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think effective mobilization livered cannot be overstated how important that is because to to get enough control of the vena cave And this segment really requires dividing the attachments of the liver to the diaphragm and and getting the liver well mobile so that so that it can be moved Cephalad And allow exposure of this segment So I think what to be mindful of is is in this area this this is just a very difficult area because inevitably there are lumbar veins coming from the backside of of this aspect of the vena cava in inevitably to to control The the cephalad portion of this area there’s likely to be a couple of hepatic veins that are coming into this area So it is in a mobilization liver I think is very important to to allow exposure I think we mentioned I guess to start the the medial visceral rotation of the right colon and the head of the pancreas all of that has to really be I think maybe to your point make sure that that exposure is also very thorough so that the the third fourth portion of the Dudina M the head of the pancreas are lifted up off of this segment so that one can really expose and see as we said the outset it’s difficult to so what you can’t see you know</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And I think one point that we haven’t emphasized enough here that you emphasize in your book substantially is the fact about really being careful about your decision to mobilize the liver and how you can really make your situation worse Can you touch on that</p>
<p>There are some injuries where actually leaving the liver ACE of course retro hepatic If you get into the retro hepatic segment then and those situations often leaving the liver in places is I because it’s it’s What hemostasis may be attainable is unroof the tear and the vena cave and behind the liver So in those cases actually leaving the liver and not smoke might be beneficial and should be pursued in contrast if this is Injury to the to the super renal segment of the IBC It’s a longitudinal tear and and you sort of see it that it’s there It’s not a retro Paddick segment then and you see the bleeding is from below the liver in the Vionic Gava Then those situations in mobilizing the liver to a degree is actually maybe necessary so that you can control of the injury the fatty grains the super hepatic Vena cava is that is that before the portions are we’ve talked about the infra renal super renal retro Patrick and then super panic that is exposing that There’s also a pretty short segment air from the last of the phrenic veins that train into the new Kiva right at the cruise and then the writing heart and the pericardium So that’s a pretty short segment there to expose that area one needs to really divide up along its IFAD to really get the costal margins to open up To just go from a tip of the to the pubis Often it is not enough Really in my experience takes a very good effort to to divide up along the the edge of the two to three centimeters cephalad separating the XY from the right costume origin to really open that up and show the all of the diaphragm and and at the base of that of course Will be the vena cava And that’s sort of that fourth segment if you will that We have discussed</p>
<p>Dr. Rasmussen at least in a lot of my training I’ve been taught with a large bleeding IVC to get proximal distal control sponge sticks you’re in your book you have some precautions that you mentioned against this technique and how do you recommend approaching a</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> So I think the tenant of the sponge stick is is Is the same where the ease the sponge stick or and or a finger or another instrument you know it’s it’s I think it’s the starter right You’re trying to I got to start somewhere and there’s this black blood welling up I’ve got pressure on it so that pressure can be applied with a sponge stick or a hand I think what one recognizes that whatever you use for that initial application of pressure you’re going to have to refine your dissection You’re going to have to refine your exposure and then you’re going to have to refine that manual pressure mechanism because you can’t operate everybody’s got their hand in the woman it may not be bleeding but you can’t be there forever and you can’t see to actually disect and expose and operate So I think the the sponge sticks are fine I think so we don’t skip over it if if this is a retroparotoneil hematoma from the inferior vena cava this has gotta be exposed in my experience through visceral rotation of the right colon the seek them and the right colon up to the patient’s left exposing the vena cava You won’t be able to manage this hematoma by going through the mesentery of the right colon for example That’s so that’s a premise that this injury has gotta be managed with a medial visceral rotation of the right colon and seek them a cephalad into the patient’s left to expose this Injury Even if you start out with with the sponge stick or manual pressure before that maneuver let anesthesia catch up give blood in the room but eventually you’re going to have to mobilize that seek them and right colon up and to the patient’s left you know I think from there you know these technical tricks that you’re referring to I think trying to get the application to something smaller than the sponge sticks So oftentimes something that’s referred to as a Kitner or a peanut if you will those are lower profile you can see around them off and you can sew around them They’re smaller than the deck and oftentimes use of those which is really the similar principle of Manual pressure is I think useful you know I think all you have the sponge sticks in to the degree that one can get proximal and distal control of some of the large tributaries feeding the injury area the iliac vein then that may be useful as well the other technical tenants are you’re going to need probably two large bore suction devices lights blood in the room Don’t overlook those things as we have Sat in a couple of our other segments you know this is the type of injury where you may only get one or two chances at this You want to make those those chances as good as possible So you know the the sponge stakes are fine but they’re only going to be a starter and you’re going to have to refine your your manual pressure to something smaller so that she can disect and expose</p>
<p>so we were talking about retro paddock cable injuries and a technique that we didn’t discuss that may be useful in situations where There was blood welling up from behind the liver and it’s not clear where it’s coming from is a total vascular isolation or total Astro exclusion you walk us through that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I took a good point And I think we haven’t mentioned that And of course that is trying to isolate all the flow to the liver and reduce bleeding ultimately from the cave and the confluence of the of the paddock beans So you know if one thinks about the inflow into the liver right So that it would be the portal vein which is Probably 70 to 80% of the total flow So trying to isolate the portal vein and being able to control at least an isolate the poor to happiness and a portal vein the paddock artery through what’s called a Pringle maneuver so that’s the that’s really the inflow to the liver and then as far as that segment of the vena cava controlling You know the vena cave and the renal veins below that injured segment the the other portion of inflow So going through those steps to isolate what is inflow into the liver and that injured segment of cave at where the confluence of the paddock beans is that’s sort of the the key tributaries that need to be accounted for in that maneuver</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> And then when you’re above the injury and the super impatent Kiva Are you getting control in the area of the California so the paddock veins below the diaphragm or do you find that you need to go into the chest cave and the chest</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So that’s a great question I think when doing total hepatic isolation the the one segment which is a super hepatic segment of the vena cava I tend to cheat The question was do you go into the chest to control that segment or can you do it through the abdomen I always do it through the abdomen but when I say I cheat I suspect by the time that I I’ve done it I’ve divided the up along the cost of margin and almost started what amounts to opening the chest through the abdomen Because you’re you’re exactly right You have to get pretty high And using some deep what are referred to as long renal vein retractors the Wylie renal vein retractors that are handheld those can go down onto the cruise since it covers the vena gaven and you’re basically in the chest or just in the chest through the superior aspect of the of the abdomen I can’t emphasize in those situations how important it is to Of released the hepatic attachments to that portion of the diaphragm and then really are those costs or margins you know the cost of margins they tend to enclose around the abdomen and that’s what they do But by dividing the three to four centimeters cephalad It’s often overlooked but that really allows you to almost suspend the patient with retractors under the cost of margins And that really in a way puts you in the chest although you’re there through the peritoneal cavity</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And just for completeness sake to totally cover a total hepatic vascular exclusion if you still have bleeding after getting the super Padick and infer hepatic control and the Pringle is there an option to prevent any further flow I’m alluding to the point in your book where you talk about in this very rare situation you can do a super celiac aortic clamp to help identify the injury but the patients are unlikely to survive this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Correct I mean I think there’s a couple of there’s a couple of damage control steps You can certainly clamp the aorta to see if that helps I mean I think that’s absolutely a great point and I didn’t mean to overlook that if nothing else oftentimes clamping the is neededto support left ventricular afterload for a period of time because these patients are in rough shape or you may need to clamp the aorta as a sensitive maneuver anyway and they see that that helps or doesn’t help the other The other situation is trying to then place that then bypass you know from the basically from the inferior vena cava up into the right atrium you know these are very rare but that is a way to then bypass the liver and allow a continued Right hard from the infer renal segment is by using a shunt So that has been described as the Strock shunt and most commonly is described using the chest tube and that can be used as well as another sort of last I don’t want to say last last ditch effort but at that point like clamping the aorta you know you’re pretty well down on the list of things that you are are are trying to do</p>
<p>I think it is still a viable option I mean it’s extremely rare but I would advise all surgeons to to learn about it and then to understand what it is I think it’s unlikely that we’ll find ourselves in those situations but any of the shunting techniques the temporary SA I think it’s important to familiarize oneself with the with the principals and and to have in mind the situation in which which it might be useful So I don’t think it’s it’s not any more condemned to the history books as any other you know a modality of temporary avascular shunting</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And so as we’re starting to wrap up our venous episode we’ve covered the four segments of the vena cava And just to recap that’s their Infor renal which we can repair we can enter position we can leg gait if needed And then we have our super renal retro Pedic and super hepatic which are quite challenging injuries which we discussed in detail on kind of bail out maneuvers For those Now we’re going to talk about our portal vein which also includes our superior mesenteric vein and options in this situation so obviously if possible we’re going to you know repair an injury And obviously like we’ve said many times these injuries do not happen in isolation There’s probably multiple other injuries to the pancreas and celiac artery and who knows what else but Can we just discuss If you have a portal vein injury you’re probably in a pretty catastrophic situation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> I thinkthat it’s going to be tough So I think I mean I suppose they can tolerate it and like any damage control vascular scenario ligation is is an option you know and it may be necessary but I think ligating the main portal vein carries with it a very high mortality So I would if if I would consider gosh you know temporary vascular shontayne if at all possible although that’s obviously pretty rare if it’s like aided initially as a damage control maneuver is just trying to get things stopped then I would Get the patient stated and then I would try to reconstruct it you know because I don’t think longterm the ligated gated portal vein is going to it’s very unlikely to be survivable So if for example let’s lie gait it let’s get the bleeding stop Let’s get a Another set of hands in here Okay we’ve got the bleeding stopped It looks like the portal veins now but let’s get the patient resuscitated a little bit warmed up And let’s</p>
<p>And you mentioned in your chapter about you know for these injuries it’s very likely you may need to divide the pancreas if the projectile As in divided it for you to help get better exposure to repair One thing I felt was really interesting in your chapter is you discussed how there’s very limited experience with these injuries and and not a lot of followup but the thought is that with our current anesthesia techniques and our open abdomen techniques that these Injuries may be survivable when they weren’t in the past can you talk a little bit about the blood return from the splanchnic circulation and and why it’s important to discuss out the anesthesia and options if you do have to do an aggressive ligation and repair of this vessel</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think if I understand your question I mean as we’ve These torso vascular injuries are the most complex And and as we have discussed throughout our talk about vascular trauma the reconstructive technique whether it’s a damage control technique or a definitive repair technique needs to be done in conjunction with Anesthesia and the resuscitation team and that’s to assure that that that the tenants of damage control resuscitation are are be pursued by the team meaning blood and blood components placement prevention by Galapagos the mitigation of acidosis Optimization of relation all of those things So the I think the more complex the vascular injury the greater the consequences with that vascular injury the more important it is that we’re communicating with the anesthesia team to let them know what we’re doing And considering with regards to in this case these whether it’s a portal vein injury or a superior mesenteric vein injury it’s it’s it’s important So that damage control resuscitation occurs with damage control surgery one without the going to fail If you do perfect damage control surgery but you failed at the tenants of DCR damage control resuscitation</p>
<p>And I so just to wrap up the the portal vein and we kind of Looping in the superior mesenteric vein into this Ligation is really not tolerated but in a catastrophic situation you can consider it as long as there’s communication with anesthesia that 50% of the blood volume is going to be sequestered in the splanchnic circulation And then with management of open abdomens and aggressive fluid resuscitation there have been case reports of survival after portal vein ligation so Dr. Rasmussen once again We took you through a lot of vascular trauma today and you were very patient with us and breaking every detail down We really appreciate this and we think our listeners will also</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Thank you</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I appreciate the opportunity and I commend you for taking such a complicated topic and I hope that it’s useful and would encourage you know as we’ve said throughout our discussion encourage your Listeners to get an Atlas or a video and augment our discussion you know with with other learning techniques</p>

<p><strong>Tenets of Cerebrovascular Injury</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Control of catastrophic bleeding — with manual compression and resuscitation</li>
<li>Ensure that injury is not causing airway compromise</li>
<li>Evaluate the neurological status of patient — have a thorough baseline neuro exam and look for signs of ischemia, hemispheric stroke, arousability/mental status</li>
<li>Prevent secondary injury — maintain blood pressure to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and prevent hypoxia</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Blunt Carotid Injury Patterns</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanism of Injury: history of a motor vehicle collision, blunt force to neck, severe hyperextension, etc.</li>
<li>External signs of injury: marks on neck or around the thoracic inlet (ie “seatbelt sign”))</li>
<li>Unilateral neurodeficits — could suggest hemispheric ischemia or stroke (less common, but possible)</li>
<li>Accompanying Injuries: concomitant closed head injuries (TBIs), complex facial fractures, cervical vertebral body and transverse foramen fractures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blunt Carotid Injury Classification System and Management</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think
that as we think about this one thinks about, the anatomy of the vessel
wall, the arterial wall. that helps us conceptualize the degree or the
severity of, of these blood carotid injuries. They can be, as simple
as a, as an intimal tear, , where, you know, it is, the intimate has
been raised off of the media and it creates a minor flow defect.</p>
<p>, which may be prone to platelet aggregation. but it’s, it’s not a,
, a long dissection and it’s, it’s not a flow limiting defect, and that
is the [00:08:00] most minor. , and then of course, the most severe on
the other end of the spectrum is a blond carotid injury. That’s resulted
in. In, in complete thrombosis of the artery so that, , it’s either the
vessel has been transected from the blunt injury and is thrombosis or, ,
or the, the injury is this, such that the intimate is lifted up and it
has created a longer this section that is, that is now thrombosed and
occluded the vessel.</p>
<p>And then there’s the degrees of injury between those two extremes where.
There can be a longer does section, that, has thrombus associated
with it and is visible on the cat scan or the imaging modality, and
or, a dissection that can be flow limiting the defect that can be
flow limiting.</p>
<p>They may not have thrombus and it, or B along the section, but it, but
it is in itself flow limiting, meaning that it. It’s, , compromises
greater than 50%, for example, [00:09:00] of the, of the lumen of that
pestle. So, you know, the, the varying degrees of severity, you
know, with our imaging technologies today, mostly CTA, it is possible to
pick up, you know, or is.</p>
<p>If you’re able to pick up or proceed the different, , types of severity
from a, again, from a real mild intimal defect that’s not flow limiting,
that has no thrombus all the way to the more obvious, , you know, , ,
injury where there’s complete thrombosis.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Is there any role
for ultrasound, , in addition to CTA, if you do see some sort of intimal
flap, , to maybe see the, if there’s any hemodynamic impact of it, or is
it. Does CTA give you the information that you need.</p>
<p>I think
that’s a really good point. I love, I really like ultrasound. I think
you alluded to this, with your comment, you know, CT gives you,
gives one a static image. , it’s often quite detailed and, , boy, I
really also think that CTA [00:10:00] is, I mean, in many ways it is the
gold standard, but it is a static image.</p>
<p>Yeah. In contrast, duplex ultrasound, which combines B mode, you know,
ultrasonography with POLST Doppler , gives one a real dynamic,
assessment of the area of interest. Meaning is, is the, is there, I
mentioned the word flow limiting is, is there a elevated velocity and a
detriment in, in, in.</p>
<p>Or a change or a difference in the velocities around that area. So I
think, I think you can get a lot of information with duplex though. Of
course, the limitation with duplex, and we may talk about this, when
we talk about the different zones of. Of of, of neck injury, you know,
the, the limitation with duplex is it, it you cannot see above the angle
of the mandible.</p>
<p>So you quickly kind of run out of real estate distally where you can use
duplex. It’s not good for distal internal carotid injuries and you
cannot see, you know, proximal to the thoracic outlet. [00:11:00] So,
you know, there is a limited window in which duplex is useful. But, ,
but in that window, I think it gives really important information.</p>
<p>**That’s a great point. So going
back to the grading of the injuries, , Dr. Rasmussen, you described to
us a grade one and grade two injuries, which involve intimal injuries, ,
less than 25% in grade one or grade two with a greater than 25% luminal
narrowing. can you talk about the management of grade one and two
injuries.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think
I’m grade one and grade two injuries. Um. Most of the time are managed
non-operatively and can be managed expectantly with, , use of
antiplatelet therapy, potentially anticoagulation. depending upon,
the patient’s global burden of trauma. Do they have an associated
TBI? Do they have other, other injuries?</p>
<p>But. if, if there are, if the patient is [00:12:00] neurologically
intact, and a grade one or grade two injury is seen on imaging,
and the patient is able to have anti-platelet or anticoagulation
therapy, then those, those types of great injuries, grade one and grade
two are managed. Non-operatively, , with, , I guess you’d say medical
management.</p>
<p>If the patient changes, meaning that he or she was initially
neurologically normal, and medical management is initiated and then
the patient changes has hemispheric symptoms indicating that your
medical management is failing. Then that is a situation where, , an
intervention is, is this likely to be needed or would be indicated,
if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> That drives me is
to have a question. have you ever been in a situation where you have
a grade one or two injury, but a [00:13:00] patient that you’re unable
to get a neuro exam on? Are we obligated to, ask for things such as
transcranial Doppler or EEG or, or, or something to prove that there’s
no injury from that or, you know, what are your thoughts on a situation
like that?</p>
<p>Great
question, and I think I’m. I’ll probably use this phrase multiple times
in this discussion. Is it? It depends, partly it depends on what
modalities, one has available to them in their institution, but I think
the answer to that, if I could, if I come down from on it, is, no,
you’re not obligated.</p>
<p>I think it’s a luxury. , that some places may have that if you have
access to EEG or transcranial Doppler, it might be able to be used or
sort of a luxury in your diagnosis, but I don’t think that’s really
necessary. I would mostly treat them, as I said, with medical management
and then imaging, serial [00:14:00] imaging, both.</p>
<p>Of their neck and, of their brain. and I think in a way, and then
you mentioned it earlier, Kevin, I thought that was really important. ,
supportive measures, like preventing, secondary injury, you know, which
means optimize the profusion pressure to the brain. , try to avoid or
lessen the likelihood of secondary insults such as hypotension, shock
and, and such.</p>
<p>So I don’t think you’re obligated to get those things. I think that
things like EEG, transcranial Doppler are more in the category of a
luxury if you have them. but otherwise I would manage with a serial
imaging.</p>
<p>**So Dr. Rasmussen in a patient
who remains neurologically intact and you plan to, that medically
manage and do serial imaging, what’s the best timing for repeat imaging?</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s
a great question. And I, I think, for, for patients that we
manage and in my experience, we manage, we at least image him twice in
the hospital. While they’re an [00:15:00] inpatient. So, , to make sure
that they’re not changing or evolving, you know, in the acute phase of
their injury. So, you know, if, , if, .</p>
<p>The typical patient is someone with a, you know, with a blunt, head
injury and they have a finding at the time of, , of a grade one or grade
two carotid injury. we get the CT at the time. They’re admitted to
diagnose it. We follow them, you know, over the course of three or four
or five days as they recover from their injury.</p>
<p>They need another imaging study, I think within, you know, within the
first week to make sure that that. Grade one or grade two injury has not
evolved into an either a pseudo aneurysm, because remember, there’s a,
by definition, a disruption of the arterial wall or an extension, you
know, from a grade one or grade two into something that’s more, more
significant.</p>
<p>So I think the initial scan on admission, of course, and then within the
first seven days to make sure they’ve not, that injuries not evolving.
[00:16:00] and then typically after that, I think, again, it depends
on. sort of the severity and how the patient’s doing, but probably
at a month after discharge from the hospital and then most of them will
heal.</p>
<p>, certainly grade ones will heal, hopefully grade two, but, but they do
need followed, , to the point of resolution or healing as an outpatient.
, usually with CT scans or CTA.</p>
<p>**Okay, great. And series of
these patients have shown that 60% of them will have their injuries
devolve or change in greater severity in this period. Is the pattern
that you see typically that they tend to improve over time?</p>
<p>Well, I think
the, I think the grade, you know, the grade ones, , I think they do.
they’re, those are the ones where that’s a minor or limited intimal
disruption. A small intimal flap that. that is not flow limiting. It’s
not associated with thrombus or platelet aggregation or thrombus.</p>
<p>So I think most of the grade ones do, and I [00:17:00] think, I’m sure
the grade twos, I think it certainly a greater percentage of those are
prone to evolve into, you know, a longer deception formation of thrombus
around them or into a pseudo aneurysm. And so that’s the, the point of,
of serial imaging. You know, within the first week of the injury.</p>
<p>, and then certainly, you know, , another one within the first month of
the injury he had at best case, certainly if they begin to evolve or you
see on that second CT. That the image that the injury’s changing, let’s
say it’s a grade two to your point that you think and you see signs that
it’s evolving, then by all means then that that needs then more
intensive imaging and likely if it’s evolving into something more
significant, it needs an intervention.</p>
<p>**Okay, so a pseudo aneurysm is
what we consider grade three. what is your approach to managing a pseudo
aneurysm of the carotid?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I
think the, the suitor aneurysms [00:18:00] of the carotid, you know,
that in a way it depends. It’s influenced certainly on, the
patient’s neuro status or the location of the pseudo aneurism. And then
I think the expertise of, of the team that’s managing the patient.
but I think that the pseudo aneurysms, all of them, no matter what
size they, they need to be treated, they, they require, you know,
they require an intervention to fix them.</p>
<p>there certainly are some patients who, um. Who’s you know, have a
high mortality. They, they’re, they’re, they’re quite ill or have a
high, high injury severity score. They may not make it. There’s some
patients that one may pass and not fix a pseudo aneurysm or grade three
entry, but by and large, most do because the pseudo aneurysms will.</p>
<p>, will, they will not go away. Then they’re likely to get bigger and
become associated with either expansion and mass effect or bleeding or
thrombus formation, stroke. so, the, the ways to treat them, I
think are [00:19:00] these days primarily with endovascular techniques
that include covering, , the pseudo aneurysm with a small coverage
stent.</p>
<p>Or what we’d call a stent graft, a small covered stent to seal the, the
opening of the pseudo aneurysm. You know, there are some reports and
experiences using what we call a bare metal stent, through which
coils can be placed to thrombose the pseudo aneurysm to cause it to
clot. And then the bare metal stent then, you know, maintains the
integrity of the wall.</p>
<p>Um. Such that, flow is maintained through the, through the lumen, those
both use of a stent graft or recovered stent or coiling of the pseudo
aneurysm, or interventional techniques or endovascular techniques that
are performed most commonly through a transfemoral approach, an RJ order
gram, and then selection of the.</p>
<p>of the [00:20:00] effected carotid artery and then placement of the, of
the endovascular treatment. I think those, these days are probably
the most common. Certainly if, it is, in, you know, in zone two of
the neck, and we can talk about that a little bit. , and it’s amenable
to an operation. there’s another indication for an operation in that
area than, than certainly open repair of the pseudo aneurysm can also
be.</p>
<p>Undertaken, but I think more commonly these days for grade two injuries,
they’re managed with an endovascular technique.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> In your book,
it’s mentioned that, considering waiting seven days to decrease
neuro events, , what’s the thought behind this?</p>
<p>Yeah,
definitely. I think that, if a patient, um. You know, Harrigan, it
depends. I think that it depends on the patient. There are some patients
who just are in no shape to undergo. you know, , , an intervention
such as this in the acute, , in the acute setting, the first two or
three days and, and certainly in those patients waiting is, is just, you
don’t have a choice.</p>
<p>You need to wait. I think Yeah. If the patients, [00:21:00] you
know, are awake, let’s say they’re awake and otherwise normal, you
know, in those patients, if they’re, if it’s a pseudo aneurysm, the
patient’s awake and, , able to be examined. I, I often don’t wait seven
days. I think the waiting period probably more pertains to patients with
polytrauma, maybe an associated TBI and, and a, and a more complex, ,
complex course.</p>
<p>I think if it’s more. A cut and dry, the patient’s awake, , able to be
examined. They’re out of the unit. , then I don’t wait necessarily seven
days.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Got it. So, , for
the grade four injuries, , the occlusions, we just do medical management
for these patients if they’re already included. can you just talk to us
briefly about, how you decide on medical management, whether you were
using anti-platelets or dual anti-platelets or anticoagulation?</p>
<p>How do you go about this?</p>
<p>Yeah. So this
is really, an area where it is, you know, we don’t have a lot of
good, we don’t have really any good data. We have. [00:22:00] Really
good clinical experiences by a lot of expert groups, but we don’t have a
lot of, prospective data or level one data that guides our
management in these cases.</p>
<p>and so I think, patients with occluded, let’s say a blunt
carotid and secluded grade for injury, patients who do not have
associated injuries or conditions. That preclude the use of
anticoagulation, then I will use the anticoagulation. We’ll, we’ll give
them, , intravenous heparin, and, monitor them with repeat
imaging and obviously, monitor them to make sure they’re not over
anticoagulated in pain.</p>
<p>And that tends to be the exception because many of these patients have
polytrauma, so they have an associated TBI. Or other body regions that
have been severely injured. So that anticoagulation is not an option.
And in those cases, , we are really left with using, um. , [00:23:00] an
antiplatelet like, clopidogrel or aspirin.</p>
<p>In those cases, I’ll often use both, , dual antiplatelet therapy,
clopidogrel and aspirin. And these are in patients who cannot receive
full anticoagulation because of other injuries. one point there, I
think if, if one’s going to use anticoagulation, and I think this group,
you know, Kevin, you and Nicole are, and those of us who get called
frequently for bleeding complications are sensitive to this.</p>
<p>But in these, these patients, we’re going to use anticoagulation on for
a blunt grade four blond carotid injury. I really try to avoid, ,
protocol based, bolusing. Of anticoagulation. I think our internal
medicine friends and often our intensivist get into these protocols
where they’ll use large boluses of heparin as if the patient’s being
treated for a PE.</p>
<p>And I think that, I try to avoid that because I, in my experience, that
leads to [00:24:00] bleeding complications either in the brain. The neck
or somewhere else in these injured patients. So I typically will, when I
start anticoagulation on these patients start pretty slow with a goal
PTT of 50 to 70 and in the first 24 hours, I often will say 50 is better
than 70 because these patients with this type of trauma are just prone
to bleed.</p>
<p>and then work up slowly to therapeutic anticoagulation without
boluses. and again, these are patients that they use the
anticoagulation and the don’t have on the, they shouldn’t have other
major injuries. So then they get transitioned to an oral anticoagulant
for, 30 to 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> That’s a really
good point.</p>
<p>**Okay, great. So why don’t we
move on to discuss blend for tibial artery. Injuries, Dr. Rasmussen,
when you’re assessing a patient’s imaging who is presenting with a
trauma and a blunt vertebral artery injury, what are the kinds of things
that you look for in terms of the dominance of the vertebral,[00:25:00]
and how that affects your management?</p>
<p>Yeah, good
point. And you’ve used. Kindly, , , tips, pointing me in the right
direction. I think it, depends upon, you know, one of the main things
is, , well, first of all, starting with a physical exam, and as we’ve
mentioned, you know, how, how is the patient, when you first assess
them, do they have.</p>
<p>No signs of bleeding in the neck, airway compromise, et cetera. But
then, you know, quickly with these patients, and to your point, you get
to the imaging and, and I think one of the key things is it, which
vertebral, is it the dominant vertebral artery that is affected? Or is
it the diminutive, for TBL? Or, or maybe you can’t tell.</p>
<p>but I think that is important. and then I think, It’s similar in
some ways to the carotid injuries. It’s the severity of that vertebral
injury, both its location, anatomically which of the vertebral
segments. And then, you know, what is the, what is the severity of the
injury?</p>
<p>Is that a mild. grade one intimal flap [00:26:00] that’s sort of seems
non flow limiting, or is it a full full blown occlusion, , , of the
vertebral? And then lastly, is it associated with a baseline artery
defactor posterior circulation, stroke? Those are sort of the things
that I try to go through in my mind.</p>
<p>Um. As I look at the imaging, you know, one thing that’s important to
mention, and we were just talking about this with one of our residents
or trainees, , last week we did a first rib resection and talked about,
the severity of, of impact that it takes to make these create these
sorts of sorts of injuries.</p>
<p>You know, I think. What I would say is yes, be focused on the vertebral
artery, or in the case of the carotid, be focused on the carotid, but
also be aware that in, oftentimes these cases can be associated with
other torso, vascular injuries, blunt aortic injuries and such. So, you
know, like, like we always try to do ourselves or teach.</p>
<p>You know, don’t get tunnel [00:27:00] vision with these patients. Look
at their imaging with regards to the vertebral, but also be aware that,
, they often have other injuries that you need to open the aperture to
see.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> That’s great.
from my experience, , most of these injuries of the routine rules are
managed non-operatively or occasionally with embolization, maybe, by
neuro, I R. unless there’s maybe a pseudo aneurysm, and per your book,
90% of these stenotic lesions will resolve. Um. Is that the experience
that you have to,</p>
<p>Yes. And I
think the, you know, this, they fall into a similar management pattern,
is the blunt carotid injuries. maybe not quite the same because
their natural history is a little different, but, but I think the, you
know, as far as serial imaging, management with, , either expectant
medical management for burn for those that are, that are less severe,
and then endovascular management.</p>
<p>with those that are more severe, I think, you know, in a way, they
do fall into a [00:28:00] similar management pattern. And yes, , the
majority of those that, , that are low grade do resolve for or become
asymptomatic over the long period. Meaning they may, the receivable may,
may, if it’s thrombosis, I mean, oftentimes that does not result in.</p>
<p>Stroke. It just, depends, you know, but many of the smaller injuries
certainly do resolve over time. , and, and that can be seen with the
serial imaging approach that we’ve already talked about.</p>
<p>**So Dr. Rasmussen, Kevin
mentioned that a lot of these vertebral injuries, especially if they’re
kind of high up. In the neck or the skull base are managed by neuro IRR
or conservatively, but if you need to expose the proximal vertebral
artery in the neck, what’s your approach for that surgically.</p>
<p>Right? So
that’s a, that is exposed through a supraclavicular incision. and
for those who have, um. Looked at up or [00:29:00] performed, a
carotid subclavian bypass, for example, or the, the exposure of the
subclavian artery. Most mostly that exposure, or most commonly that
supraclavicular incision is, is described for exposure of the, the, of
the subclavian artery.</p>
<p>but through that same supraclavicular exposure, um. No, the
vertebral artery can be found a little bit more proximal on the
subclavian artery. So that’s, that’s sort of the, that’s the, that’s the
incision or approach. and you know, it depends upon the, you know,
one, you know, what one is operating for, if it’s, if it’s for, for
bleeding and the intent is to, to control bleeding or ligated, that’s
actually most commonly.</p>
<p>The case, I mean, is, is that, , you know, that exposure is then used
because it’s a hematoma and, and there’s, , there’s bleeding. you
know, then the intent is to expose, , the, the vertebral is, it
comes off of the, the subclavian and to [00:30:00] litigate it, it’s
rare that one would be repairing or trying to restore flow in the
setting of trauma.</p>
<p>to the vertebral artery, you know, through that incision. We don’t
really typically do for Teebo reconstructions for trauma. typically if
you’re doing it through an open operation, it’s really to control
bleeding and, and, , probably gonna end up lying eight in it, just
because a re implanting the vertebral, you know, on the common carotid
or doing some sort of achievable reconstruction is just not well suited
for for the trauma situation, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Yeah. And one
quick thing before we move on, I just wanted to touch you on a paragraph
that I took from your book. that I think is really important because
we don’t do. Artery exposure as much. I’ve only really done one in
fellowship. I’ve been a lot of credit subclavians where I see it, but an
actual exposure for TB and your book, it mentions you go in between the
two heads of the SCM.</p>
<p>you open up the credit chief and you retract the carotid
immediately, and this will you, then you’ll be able to identify this is
a critical [00:31:00] structure of the vertebral vein, which directly
posterior, which is directly posterior to the carotid. And this
vertebral vein is sort of a landmark that helps you identify the
vertebral artery and the proximal subclavian artery.</p>
<p>And the one of these that I’ve done that was exactly the, anatomic,
exposure</p>
<p>Yeah. Good
point. We didn’t tie, I didn’t talk about the anatomy or the specific
anatomical aspects. That’s exactly right. I mean, I think one of the
things, a couple of things that are useful in addition to to the
vertebral vein, I think that, um. I think that identifying, the sternal
head and the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid, you know, and
trying to find it really in a lot of ways, you can go between those two
heads of the sternocleidomastoid.</p>
<p>and it’s in that sort of, that groove there where one can, and,
and oftentimes that’s just a, I mean, it is, there’s an open plane there
between the, and if you can look at your anatomy book, kind of get that
out and see the. The sternal head and the clinic killer had, , really
the window there, lead you then, you know, to that area where
posteriorly, there [00:32:00] will be the, the vertebral artery will
come off.</p>
<p>And so claiming, you know, you can feel the carotid, and it’s
just beyond, it’s just beyond the takeoff, at least on the right is
just beyond the takeoff of the carotid artery.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Great. And now
that we’re kind of talking about operations and we’re going to keep
diving into penetrating injuries of the neck. So dr , we just want to
just kind of start with some of the basics, , when we’re talking about
the zones of the neck, , and, and what are the anatomic considerations
of each of these zones.</p>
<p>can you just tell us what zone one is and kind of what you’re
thinking of if you hear of a vascular injury in this area?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you
know, so zone one, so the zones of the neck, you know, really, refer
to the, the anterior, aspects of the neck. and so the, the
sort of the anterior triangles of the neck, and, um. The zone one really
is, is the most proximal. It’s the inferior, , aspects of the, , of
that, of that.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> So doctor asked
me, he said, I think we’re going to dive now into penetrating carotid
trauma and start with sort of the basics, , diving into the zones of the
neck and some of the things you take into consideration with each of
these zones in the neck as far as getting control.</p>
<p>So the
zones of the neck, that are, have been used to help us
conceptualize, you know, penetrating injury mostly. . Oh, really?
Apply to the anterior portion of the neck. , kind of the anterior
triangle of the neck. zone one is, is the, is the, , is the sort of
the first and the most, I guess.</p>
<p>proximal zone, and it’s really defined, by the sternal notch to
the cricoid cartilage. So it’s a tight or narrow zone that really
involves the thoracic outlet. zone two is the cricoid cartilage to
the angle of the mandible, which is, sort of the largest of the, of
the three zones, , in the [00:33:00] neck, the intern neck.</p>
<p>And then zone three is from the angle of the mandible to the base of the
skull. Like, zone one’s on three’s pretty tight. there’s not a lot
of space there. and those zones, I think are useful and that
have been described. , there was original paper led by, dr rune, R
O, N, H, J rune, and, , , in the journal of trauma in 1979 that, first
described those, those zones, it was called evaluation and treatment
of penetrating cervical, , injuries and in those zones I think are
really useful just as a, to help us conceptualize into, to try to, ,
manage, different forms of penetrating injury or different areas of
penetrating injury.</p>
<p>so those are the zones. , I think that. You know, teaching, , at
least over the years has been the, penetrating injuries to zone one and
zone three largely, require, you know, imaging at the outset.
and maybe either non-operative repair or at least imaging first with, ,
because they’re very difficult areas to expose penetrating injuries to
[00:34:00] zone two.</p>
<p>traditionally have been in the teaching has been that those are all
managed with, , an open operation and exploration of the neck.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> and then for
zone three, sort of, I think, much like zone one, , we depend on sort of
imaging and angiography, , for treatment of these injuries. kind of want
to dive straight into this and, , discuss how do we manage credit
injuries. So we’re, we’re going to just pitch some scenarios at you and
we, can discuss some of the nuances of it.</p>
<p>Um. If you have a penetrating carotid injury, zone two, , and the
patient is neuro intact. I mean, it’s this kind of the most
straightforward situation. But, , I guess, I guess a better question to
you is, is , if they’re neurologically intact, how do we determine
whether or not you’re going to repair the credit injury</p>
<p>Yeah. I well,
I think probably the case-based scenarios are probably best because. You
know, each management, as I mentioned, the zones are there to
provide some conceptualization, help us to categorize our management.
But, , the, management of any given cases is often, individualized.</p>
<p>So in this particular case, yes, I mean, whether or [00:35:00] not
they’re, neurologically intact certainly matters. I think with
penetrating zone to injury, um. I would still operate on that. I think
that, that, that, I think that paradigm is changing with modern
imaging technologies, CTA mostly, and clinical experience.</p>
<p>But I think that teaching is in the case that you’ve presented a
penetrating zone to neck injury with a carotid or penetrating zone to
wound with a carotid injury, then that patient would be. Operated on
with an open operation.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> the neurodeficit
portion of it, you know, historically there was concerns over if you
repair this carotid injury, you know, that you could create
intercranial hemorrhage. So, say you have a patient that comes in with a
zone, two injury with, , you know, on the right neck with. Left-sided
neuro symptoms. w what are your thoughts on that? Does, does the
neuro status play into it or do you repair, the carotid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think
that, and these days, you know, as I mentioned or alluded to, we have
the benefit of CT imaging. So, you know, the, the [00:36:00] paradigm of
that was. I mentioned the, AGA rune paper from 1979 and that really set
up the, the zones, you know, that was in really, that was in an era
where we did not have, and for many decades after that, we didn’t really
have the benefit of routine high quality contrast CT imaging.</p>
<p>Today we’re operating in that, , in this new era with. Routine, high
contrast or high quality contrast CT scan. So, I think in your case,
you know it, if the injury has a CT scan, which is likely to have
these days unless the, unless the injury was associated with bleeding
and the patient was just taken immediately to the, or, you’re going to
have a CT image.</p>
<p>If the CT image shows. You know, a grade one type of injury, you almost
extrapolating the, you know, the, the blunt characterization or the
blunt categories. If it’s zone one, then I suppose, you know, those may
also, you know, may not choose to operate on those, but I think
penetrating wounds, I would, [00:37:00] I would operate on them and I
think, um.</p>
<p>No. Cause I think they’re going to evolve. And they, the other thing
about exploring zone to the neck is that you can explore for other
Aerojet aerodigestive injuries. I mean that, that’s the other dictum or
part of this is to make sure that there’s not an injury to the, to the,
, to the airway or to the esophagus, as, as, as you perform the zone to
neck exploration.</p>
<p>So, um. You know, I think that they get, , an exploration. They get a,
you see the carotid, , and , , you explore and you see the injury and
then you manage it depending upon what the injury looks like at the time
of open exploration. I mean, it’s hard. I think it would be hard for me
to sit on a penetrating zone to wound that has a.</p>
<p>Carotid injury, I, it’s potentially described. , and I think,
but I think, there’s a couple of reasons that I would err on the
side of, of operating on that.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Yeah. And I
think, , historically, they talked about, like I mentioned, the
intercranial hemorrhage. So if you had, say, a, , a very, , beat
[00:38:00] up looking carotid artery, or maybe. near thrombosis that
they would leave it, because they’re afraid of reproducing the
brain, causing intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<p>But it seems like the consensus now, at least from your book and the
East guidelines is, to repair these deficits, , or to repair these
credit injuries because the mortality and final nerdy neuro status, ,
has been shown to be better in these patients. even if they started with
a neurodeficit.</p>
<p>And I think
that we, you know, as vascular surgeons who do carotid endarterectomy, ,
routinely, I think we’re more so, I don’t, I do not. So, first of all,
this is a complex, . Complex scenario. So I, I’m definitely won’t throw
shade on any previous experiences with this sort of heroin, injury
pattern.</p>
<p>I do think that we, um. You know, for those of us who manage and perform
carotid endarterectomy routinely, we sort of are, are familiar, I guess,
when maybe not good with it, but we’re at least familiar with trying to
mitigate hyperperfusion syndrome or reprofusion syndrome. And I think
that is, you know, that’s just part of the, the management.</p>
<p>There’s the technical management of the injury, and then there’s the
communication with anesthesia to try to lower the blood pressure and the
overall profusion pressure. in these patients after you repair the
carotid, it’s not unlike communicating with anesthesia about
resuscitation, right?</p>
<p>We need to, communicate with anesthesia in this case, to mitigate
hyperperfusion or reprofusion and worsening of a brain injury. We, we,
need to, , [00:39:00] communicate with anesthesia as well as do a good
job of fixing the, the injury.</p>
<p>**That is a great point. what
about in a situation where you have a patient who has a large infarct.
On the same side as a carotid injury. What is your approach in that
situation?</p>
<p>Yeah. So I
think, you know, and it depends upon the injury. you know, I think
if this is a penetrating zone to wound. you know, in nearly all
instances, you know, so you’re going to explore it. because it’s his
own two neck injury. I mean, I, I think, um. You know? Okay. So
there may be some that are, that are sort of there.</p>
<p>I’m trying to avoid the words. It depends. you know, I suppose there
are some minor penetrating injuries where the, the image, , you know,
it’s a small stab wound or ice pick type of thing. , in, in, in,
there’s, there’s, there’s no hematoma. It’s looks like there’s a injury
to the carotid. That’s, , that’s, that’s, .</p>
<p>, resulted in, , in an infarct or a stroke, but there’s no bleeding or
pseudo aneurysm. there might be scenarios where you would observe
it. I, I don’t, that’s not a practice that I, a spouse. I would explore
all of these. I still sort of fall, fall back on exploring all
penetrating zone two injuries. and in that case then you’re going to
be in the neck anyway.</p>
<p>You’re going to see the injury to the carotid. And I guess your
question. Nicole is in the setting of an infarct, would you then repair
the carotid? I mean, your options are either to repair it, do
nothing to it or, or lie gated and I guess as a vascular surgeon,
you know, I would repair it. I think observing [00:40:00] it while
you’re there looking at it is then you risk it evolving into a pseudo
aneurysm and you having to re operate on it, you know, days or weeks
later.</p>
<p>As it is, the small injuries of all. and I think, you know, the, the
question of, well, if he’s already at the patient already has an
infarct, would you like it? I think that that don’t, that’s just not
something that is a vascular surgeon, that, that I would pursue. I
think, I would try to, , I would try to repair the injury
reperfused the hemisphere.</p>
<p>acknowledged that, yes, you could make things worse with
reprofusion. but, , you also may take up a number that was ischemic and
you may reproduce it and, and push the penumbra in a positive direction.
So, you know, there’s not a lot of data in this area. And I mentioned
the word heroin. you know, these are the most challenging of, of
injury scenarios for sure.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Definitely. Yeah.
there’s no easy answers there,</p>
<p>I mean, what
do you think, Nicole? What do you guys think and what’s your experience?
I mean, I, [00:41:00] I’m, I’m interested also in what you guys think
about that case.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> I have one
experience with this. It was in residency. we had a, a person that
was sleeping and, , a, a pressure washer guy came up to him and asked
him to move. He refused to move and they got in a fight and I got the
pressure washer straight to the neck. , tore open his carotid. They came
into the ER holding pressure on his neck and huge hemiparesis on the
contralateral side.</p>
<p>in that case, we did repair the carotid, and he did have a dense
hemiparesis after the case. you know, whether litigating would have
helped or not, you know, we don’t know, but that, that’s my, that’s my
one experience.</p>
<p>** I actually haven’t seen a
situation like this,</p>
<p>but it’s definitely a tough, it’s a tough situation. I think if you have
an injury that’s going to cause potential for bleeding or a pseudo
aneurysm. And the vessel is payment, then my [00:42:00] inclination
would be to repair it. if you’re doing, if you have like an
occlusion of the artery, when you explore it, you know, say you try to
do a thrombectomy and you’re not getting any retrograde bleeding.</p>
<p>That might be a situation where I’ve considered ligating it, but these
are tough calls.</p>
<p>I think
you’re, I think you’re spot on. And I think as surgeons, you know, at
you know, at some point, , you know, I won’t speak for other
of my colleagues. , and I’m not saying that we. Try to teach this mantra
to our trainees. But you know, sometimes what comes to mind is, well,
don’t overthink it. you’re a vascular surgeon.</p>
<p>You’ve explored a vascular injury. There’s a hole in the artery or
disrupted artery, do what we do, which is fix it. And, again, I
don’t mean to be, , overly simplistic. I’m not trying to be, ,
sarcastic, but I, I think we get to that point. Where you know you’re
going to have to fix it.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult to just not do anything. And I think, in
the case that you described Kevin, I think that’s important. You do
need to know going into these, that the outcome’s going to be likely to
be stroke. You know, whether you make the stroke better or worse,
you’re not [00:43:00] really going to know by fixing the artery.</p>
<p>Um. And so the outcome’s going to be pretty bad. , either way, I think
that’s important for family and the patients and, for the care team to
recognize. these situations, but, to me fixing it as, unless
Nicole, you bring up a good point. If the carotids occluded, then yeah,
I think then that is a time when I would like eat it.</p>
<p>And I think this is where we fall back on our experience with carotid
endarterectomy and managing, you know, a string sign that we thought was
there from a carotid occlusive disease. And you explore the string sign.
And by the way, the carotid was occluded. In those cases, in a setting
of a carotid endarterectomy, we actually likely ligated.</p>
<p>, and so I think we fall back on some of the similar principles that we
pursue and we’re fixing age related carotid disease.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> Definitely, , and
for completeness sake, there’s another large. That’s hole in the neck, ,
that we encounter injuries to, , what is your thought on, , internal
jugular injuries? , can you like eight one, two, or</p>
<p>Yeah, I
think, , I mean, you certainly can. [00:44:00] One can certainly, ,
like eight, these I think, and not have. consequential
effects in most patients. internal carotid arteries that are, I’m
sorry, the internal jugular veins that I have repaired have been in the
situation of a significant TBI.</p>
<p>So a patient has, you know, , bleeding in the neck. You explore,
explore the. the neck and the patient also has a penetrating wound to
the head and intracranial hypertension and, you know, needed a
decompressive craniectomy or something. in those cases, I have repaired
the internal jugular vein to maintain venous outflow of that side of the
brain.</p>
<p>you know, I’m never sure whether or not that is necessary, but,
you know, I think it, it makes sense to me. I think, . In one case, I
remember before I repaired the internal jugular vein, you know, we
transduced a venous pressure, , towards the cranial side, and the venous
pressure was, you know, 40 or 50 millimeters of mercury, and there was a
gradient, right?</p>
<p>Eight millimeters of [00:45:00] mercury on the, on the cardiac side, or
the proximal or central side. So to me, if there’s a gradient, and
the patient’s got a TBI. you know, I think fixing it is at least
reasonable. but most of the time you can lie gate, the external jugular,
, the internal juggler.</p>
<p>and there’s enough collateral, venous drainage that, , the patients
will do fine.</p>
<p>**Okay. So going back to repair
of the carotid artery and these, , trauma situations. So, you know, we
fall back on the standard steps that we use in, you know, other
types of vascular surgery. , the first thing being getting proximal and
distal control. And then Dr. Rasmussen, can you speak to us about
heparin ization and how you manage that in the trauma setting?</p>
<p>Yeah. I think
this is, I’m in this injury pattern more than, more than most or
more than any other arterial injury pattern. You, you’ve, you have to
use heparin in these cases. So, you know, it’s a, , in some injury
patterns, you kind of have to be ready for a wild ride. Because because
you explore the neck for bleeding [00:46:00] in a, and if the patient
has poly trauma, there’s bleeding elsewhere.</p>
<p>and now you’re going to fix the carotid artery, , in some manner.
You’re going to either put in a shunt or, or just repair it primarily,
or you’re going to have to, if you’re going to clamp the carotid artery,
, in my experience, you’re going to need to use heparin. And so what I
mean by a wild dried is, you know, you’re.</p>
<p>Explore the patient for bleeding, they’re already bleeding. And now what
do you do? You give more heparin. the key there is to try to fix the
carotid is, you know, as quickly as you can, , try to manage the, the
other areas of bleeding while the patients have denies. and then,
you know, bring them off of pepper and after the carotid is repaired.</p>
<p>I think unlike, for example, I think there’s extremity arterial injuries
that can sometimes be managed without heparin. But I think if you’re
going to go to the trouble of, , in the, in the, in the technical,
challenge of, fixing a traumatic carotid injury, I think in nearly
[00:47:00] every case you got to give systemic, , heparin.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> so you know, you
have proximal and distal control. Now the patients have pronounced,
and how, how do you decide, whether to use a shunt or not and what
type of shot do you use.</p>
<p>Yeah. So,
you know, so the tenants are not, and so once you’ve done that, the
tenants are similar to other Cherrelle injuries. you need to,
identify the injury and then. Remove the burden of thrombus. Often that
can be done with flushing, you know, back bleeding of the internal
carotid or back blading and for bleeding.</p>
<p>And then, passage of a thrombectomy catheter, obviously passing a
thrombectomy catheter up. The internal carotid needs to be done. you
know, very carefully. It’s usually a two or three Fogarty catheter and
just a centimeter two. You really don’t want to be putting a Fogarty
catheter. Distill into the internal carotid more than a centimeter too.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can rely on back bleeding, you know, and back bleeding
from that internal can quote unquote blow out any thrombus that’s there.
same with the proximal, but do [00:48:00] be aware that you need to
get rid of the thrombus burden in those arteries before you fix them.
whether or not to use a shunt, I mean, I think in most cases of
trauma, um.</p>
<p>I, I have to say that I do not use a shunt, because it’s, it’s too,
it adds just another level of complexity to a case that’s already
complex. and if I were to use a Shaunte, I would use either an
Argyle, Sean’s or a short son. Shant, S U N D T. , or the Argyle.
Shawn’s. I think it’s reasonable to do that.</p>
<p>let’s say you’ve got a long segment, the loss of the carotid
artery, you’re going to need to do an interposition graft, let’s say.
and, and in that case, you, you know, you’re going to have to go
harvest vein. you know, in those cases, I suppose, sure. It’s,
it’s reasonable in those cases to put in a shunt to reproduce that
hemisphere of the brain.</p>
<p>, while the conduit is, is harvested or prepared. so certainly there
are times when I have used a shunt in the setting of trauma, but, I
always also, I also try to keep in mind [00:49:00] too, in the case of
carotid trauma, to try to keep it as simple as possible. Keep in mind,
That the internal carotid can also be transposed over onto the
external carotid artery as a transposition.</p>
<p>You know, in some cases, depending upon the precise location of the
injury, so that, you know, you don’t need an interposition graft. And in
those cases, you know, you would not use a either. Um. So, you know, I
think, yeah, be, be mindful to use the shot and be ready, sort of think
about it, but also, if you find that fixing, it sets up pretty
quickly, either with an interposition graft or with a carotid
transmission transposing the internal onto the external.</p>
<p>If that sets up pretty quickly, , I do not think you should feel
obligated to use a shunt in the setting of trauma.</p>
<p>**Okay. Great. so. Options
for repair dictated somewhat by the injury and the size of the injury.
you mentioned harvesting vein. I think that’s a good point,
especially in cases where you’re [00:50:00] exploring the neck and
there’s also an aerodigestive injury, in order to avoid putting
prosthetic in the vein option is nice.</p>
<p>what if you have a small injury and you’re just planning to do a
patch?</p>
<p>So, For the
patch, I would either use, , personally, I would use Dacron or, , ,
bovine pericardium. You know, I think something, some prosthetic that’s
available, , you know, hemophilia Dacron patch, , or bovine pericardi
as a patch. And I think, you know, you raise a really good point
there that I think if it’s, clearly a contaminated wound.</p>
<p>A penetrating wound where, you know, whether it’s because there’s an
injury to the esophagus or the airway, or it’s a shotgun wound, and so
there’s a large soft tissue injury or a fragment wound that’s really
contaminated. Then I think in those cases, yes, I think efforts to
harvest vein sappiness Maine probably, are advised, um.</p>
<p>I will say that if it’s the opposite of that, if it’s sort of a simple
penetrating wound, there’s no evidence, at least overt evidence of
aerodigestive injury. There’s no really other contamination. Let’s say
it’s a stab wound. , , you know, and it’s not a big [00:51:00] soft
tissue all quickly, , also use, , , Dacron or PTFE and, or position
graft and not use the, as I mentioned before, I think, um.</p>
<p>You know, you try to be mindful of keeping these operations, you
know, as, as, , expeditious as possible. You try to move them along.
And, in the case where there’s not a lot of contamination, or
any contamination, I also will then not use me. You know, I think, ,
, using a Dacron interposition graft or PTFE in this larger vessel,
these common carotid is, .</p>
<p>**Okay, great. Then I think one
important point also to mention is that you need to debris back any
devitalized tissue. so you know, if there’s a defect in the artery,
but the tissue around it is pretty ratty. You know, you may have to
actually debried it back and make the defect larger initially before you
repair it.</p>
<p>Really good
point. Yeah. This ma’am. And the same with us, Sean. That’s why. You
know, I said, be ready to use a shot. [00:52:00] Certainly in some
situations you need to use a shun, but you know, using the shot, you can
also, , either create a concrete, you know, an injury or cause you to
need to debris the artery back a little further.</p>
<p>so really good point.</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> , start, you’re
asking some, one point that I picked up from reading your chapter here
is that, , we’re talking about back bleeding from the internal carotid
and it made the point of back bleeding is restored. , you should perform
an interrupt angiogram. To document complete evacuation of distal
thrombus.</p>
<p>can you just speak to this.</p>
<p>Yeah. I
think, a completion study, um. is is definitely, , something to,
consider or to perform. Now, I think we’ve used the, we’ve, we’ve used
the phrase during our discussion here this afternoon, , a luxury. You
know, there’s some of these things that you have the luxury to do. You
know, in some cases of trauma, you, may not have the luxury to perform.</p>
<p>an on the table. Arteriogram so, in those cases, I would use duplex,
, if you have duplex or even, use , the, [00:53:00] duplex function of,
the ultrasound that you have in the, or to show flow. you know, and
then the, the most simple thing is a continuous wave Doppler.</p>
<p>And so some form of assessment of your repair certainly is indicated.
the complexity of that completion exam depends on what. Capabilities
you have and how the patient’s doing. so certainly in an ideal
situation, you’re fully outfitted. You’ve got, , experienced colleague
or partner or fellow with you, and, you know, the patient is on the
right imaging table and you can do a completion arteriogram then
absolutely.</p>
<p>I would, , put a, 18 gauge butterfly in the common carotid artery. Make
sure it’s. The aired so that you don’t inject air and shoot a completion
arteriogram, , both the repair and the distal internal carotid to assure
that there’s no thrombus in situations where you’re not that outfitted
and you don’t have that luxury then using a duplex ultrasound.</p>
<p>I think is, [00:54:00] is fine. And in those cases, you don’t have
duplex or the patients just, . , has enough injuries that are in his, in
a complicated enough situation using a continuous wave Doppler and, and,
and just, finishing up is also</p>
<p>**I’m curious. Dr. Rasmussen, do
you use a completion imaging study for elective carotid repairs?</p>
<p>At this
point? yeah, we use, , ultrasound. We use duplex ultrasound, but not
arteriography. I mean, I think that the arteriography point is, , is
useful. I appreciate that. And, , I think, for those who have done that
before and are used to doing it, it’s reasonable. The, the counter to
that would be, well, let’s say you see a little bit of thrombus. in the
distal internal, beyond your room repair, what are you going to do about
it? so it, it’s not to make light of or diminish the need for,
confirming a technically adequate or perfect repair. but I think,
[00:55:00] to some of my previous comments, you know, we as surgeons, I
think, try to strike this balance between, I mean, um.</p>
<p>You know, being perfect and then spending too much time overthinking it
and, , , carotid angiography completion angiography in the setting of
trauma may just not be feasible in a lot of cases. or people may not
have the experience in doing it.</p>
<p>**Right. Okay, so what if there’s
a concomitant tracheal or esophageal injury? Do you do anything</p>
<p>Well, I mean,
I think we, we didn’t mention the word, we didn’t mention drains. So,
you know, in all of these cases where we’ve explored his own to
penetrate a neck injury, those patients are all drained. , with, , you
know, for me, , , a seven millimeter flat JP drain or, or maybe more,
I guess that’s a great question.</p>
<p>I don’t know that there’s a situation where I really buttressed , or
done used any adjuncts [00:56:00] to cover my repair. the
vascularity of the neck. um. is good and if not, great. And I think
that helps. I think if you’ve drained the, , the, , the, the wound that
is also sort of a mitigating step.</p>
<p>And I’m not sure that I have buttressed, , or done anything, more
than that to protect the arterial repair. And maybe it’s because I’ve
not had any that have had. overt esophageal injury. They may be, you
know, micro injury or something like that. Small. do you think, Nicole?</p>
<p>**I’ve heard of using a muscle
flap to separate the. Esophageal injury from the arterial injury, but
I’m not sure if that’s always necessary. And I do like the idea of the
drain, because that would prevent any</p>
<p>collection from building up there that could compromise your</p>
<p>arterial repair.</p>
<p>I think that
those are both. Good points. I think the drain is in my mind, the drains
of mosque. Even if you explore the zone too. Yeah. You still know,
[00:57:00] because remember many of this opera deal injury, you just not
going to see, and honestly. I don’t know that any of us are familiar
enough with exposing the esophagus, , through that wound, we, we may
sort of see the esophagus, and do the best we can, but many of this off
the GL injuries will be pretty small, or we may not see them.</p>
<p>, so I think that, , the drain is a must, , in these injuries, at least
one and a muscle flap, I guess is something to consider if there’s gross
contamination. You know, either spillage from a softened geo wound or
they’re just gross contamination, the wound.</p>

forward to. A good discussion on a, on a, I think a really important
topic. Thank you. Great.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> [00:01:00] And , , we also have Dr. Wayne Kasi. He’s
the chief of vascular surgery at San Antonio military medical center at
a level one trauma center in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>And he’s an associate professor of surgery at the uniformed services,
university of health sciences. So a welcome,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> All right , well, let’s just dive in. We’re going to
focus first on the blunt, thoracic aortic injury and the endovascular
management of that. So I think it’s important to understand.</p>
<p>how this occurs and what patients is occurs in. So blunt, thoracic Edric
injury is rare, but it’s very lethal. It’s less than 1% of all blunt
traumas, but it’s the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yes, Kevin, that’s why whenever I’m called about a
patient who has a blunt aortic injury.</p>
<p>I really want to know what their other injuries are because these are
usually very high velocity mechanism injuries, and there’s a particular
concern that they’ll have an intracranial injury.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Right. So, you know, when you’re the trauma resident ,
, taking pages, you know, the things you want to think about, that’ll
clue you into , , you know, we need to make sure they don’t have this as
a high-speed motor [00:02:00] vehicle collisions, motorcycle crashes
vehicle versus pedestrians and falls from Heights are some of the most
common causes of blunt, thoracic aortic injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> it’s most vascular surgeons have seen. It’s pretty
amazing. Now the types of injuries people can survive. I mean, I’ve seen
people in cars who fallen over overpass, fallen off of overpasses people
being hit by trains, the prehospital management and the vehicle safety
features that exist now have really expanded what survivable.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. And , um, yeah. Quickly, we’re going to just
kind of review some of the anatomy of where these injuries occur is. Um,
so the aortic arch itself is relatively mobile. It doesn’t have a lot of
tethering, but the descending thoracic aorta itself is actually kind of
tethered. And so , , it’s it’s at that junction just distal , , to the.</p>
<p>Subclavian artery , um, is where these injuries generally occur. Most of
them curved within about a half centimeter to two centimeters of the
left subclavian artery. And so it’s at that junction that , , that the
aorta tears due to the deceleration. Um, so Wayne, do you have any
particular thoughts on the diagnostic methods for these?[00:03:00]</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Well, I think most trauma centers have a pretty good
protocol, such as the level one trauma center we work at. Typically the
patients who come in with a really high velocity mechanism, injury, get
a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. And oftentimes if
there’s an extremity that’s injured as well, that’ll just be carried
down through the , , lower extremities as well, or the upper
extremities.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Great. So yeah, CTA , um, is critical in these
patients , um, to help , , diagnose this. And so it’s important to
realize that , , patients with these injuries, the majority of them
greater than 75% never make it to the hospital. Um, and those that do
make it, the hospital are likely going to be severely injured and in
multiple other ways.</p>
<p>And it’s not gonna be an isolated injury. Um, so quickly, we’re just
gonna go over the SVS grading system. There’s a couple of ways to grade
these. The current one in the SVS is , , has four grades. The first one
is a grade one, intimal tear. Grade two is an intramural hematoma. Grade
three is a pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p>So there’s an actual contour of the aorta is [00:04:00] disrupted. And ,
, and then grade four is what they consider rupture. So those are the
four SVS grading systems and , um, When do you want to talk a little bit
about how Dr. Starnes kind of breaks it down? Yes,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Kevin that’s the official grading system. I remember
when behind the knife first started , , one of the first or second
episodes was an interview with Dr.</p>
<p>Ben Starnes. And I remember listening to his blunt, thoracic aortic
injury recommendations on the way to the hospital, as I would consult on
one of these blunt, thoracic aortic injuries. And he really categorize
these into three different categories based on his Harbor view data. ,
that was a minimal aortic injury , , which had a 10 millimeter or less
intimal tear, a moderate, which had a pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p>And then the maximal, which I think he summed up very well and saying
that there was a unilateral, hemothorax active contrast. Extravasation a
periodic hematoma greater than two centimeters in maximum width. And
those were the patients that needed to go to the operating room,
basically at the time of the consult.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that’s a great point. So the, [00:05:00]
the Dr. Star and slash Harbor view categorization is really just three
categories and they kind of depend on when you operate. So the minimal
ones you don’t operate on. Those are just the intimal tears, the
moderate ones. They need an operation, but not emergently.</p>
<p>And the Maximo ones need a, an emergent operation. And so I think that
was part of his kind of reasoning for it. One of the things</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> that. Struck me with that podcast on behind the knife
was he mentioned that what’s the point of having a grading system that.
Doesn’t have a treatment with each different grade.</p>
<p>And so as Kevin goes through these, you’ll see that there’s a little bit
of overlap between the two grades. And the point of that previous
podcast was if you’re going to have three treatments, then you need to,
which is imaging or surveillance , , delayed repair, and then urgent,
emergent, or urgent repair.</p>
<p>Then there needs to be three different grading scores,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> right? Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think Dr. Starnes in
that , , the grading system, you mentioned, I always find it to be sort
of [00:06:00] practical,, , it’s very practical, , for, for us., the,
the four category classification is, is a little bit more technical and
maybe a little less practical, but , um, yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I think it’s , , That’s true. You know, the other thing before we get
too far into this, I do think it’s useful for your listeners., , Kevin T
there, there’s a couple of classic, , um, you know, papers , , on. Blunt
aortic injury and , and, and they really speak to, for those who are
interested in vascular trauma, interested in this condition, I would ch
I would encourage you to dig into just two or three papers.</p>
<p>One of them is the original double AST paper led by Dr. Dimitrios and
the team at LA County in the late 1990s. Um, on blunt aortic injury,
which not surprisingly in the late 1990s, that double AST, what we refer
to as the WST one study showed that nearly all a blenny already injuries
were fixed with an open thoracotomy and clamping and sewing into graft.</p>
<p>Um, the WST [00:07:00] repeated that study about 10 years later and in
2006 , , or so I think it was actually published in 2008 , um, where
they , , double it’s called the double AST two study. So in the journal,
both of these were in the journal of trauma at the time. Now it’s the
journal of trauma and acute care surgery.</p>
<p>Again, led by Dr. Dimitrios says,, and, and in that 10 year period, the
management of blood aortic injury had completely. , evolved from open
repair to end a repair. And we won’t go into the details of those
studies, but , um, you know, and then you go three or four years later,
and now there’s the SBS that’s writing these guidelines.</p>
<p>So which you’ve seen in those three papers, the WST one in 1998 or nine
was T2. In 2008, both in the journal of trauma. And now the leading
organization writing the guidelines is the SBS and not the WST. What you
see there is this evolution of, of the management of this, , this,
injury pattern from open, you know, to [00:08:00] nearly exclusively
endo now.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, that is a fascinating evolution. Um, and very
interesting. I, I I’ve heard of those papers, but I didn’t realize the
transition from the, the trauma journal to the vascular journal for the
kind of guidelines on it. Um,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> surprisingly again , um, at the risk of you guys not
inviting me back, I don’t mean to monopolize the conversation, but , um,
you know, the thing that’s happened with that evolution is the
mortality, the survival of, of operating on these, these injuries has
improved.</p>
<p>Rates of paraplegia have decreased blood utilization is decreased. You
know , patients, patients have a better chance in 2020 than they did in
2000, you know, and it’s largely because of the evolution to endo , ,
technologies that we’ve. We’ve mentioned, and I</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> bet there’s not a whole lot of other specific things
in trauma that have had that big of a change or improvement in outcomes
in that amount of time.</p>
<p>So it’s pretty, it’s actually pretty special kind of a pathology and
improvement there.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yes, sir. I [00:09:00] encourage one of your
listeners to write that up. It’d be a great review. , you know, two
decade review , , two and a half decade review of, of just the broad
strokes, how that practice has changed and how paraplegia rates are down
on mortality rates.</p>
<p>It’s still a highly lethal injury, but if patients make it to the
hospital, as you were referring to , um, modern grading, modern
management techniques, give them a much better chance.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. And I, and I’ll include all those papers
in the show notes. So you can just go click the links in the show notes
here.</p>
<p>Um, we’re going to get back into the kind of management of this. Um,
there’s some things that all of these patients are going to need,
whether they’re going to get surgery or not. Um, you really want to
focus on anti impulse therapy. And generally you can do it with a beta
blockade and a short acting beta blocker is the best.</p>
<p>Um, so that’s going to be as small as generally the, the BA the beta
blocker of choice. And of course you have to talk with your neurosurgery
colleagues. Um, and we’re gonna discuss a little bit this more lately,
but. Um, you know, generally want the blood pressure less than 120
systolic. Um, it’s, there’s no guidelines on that, but it’s just sort of
consensus of, of surgeons.</p>
<p>But, you know, [00:10:00] obviously it depends on their head injury and
other what other issues they have going on. Um, and generally , , As far
as, you know, managing this small tears, the less than 10 millimeter
ones , , the guidelines recommend a CTA within 30 days. If you have a
larger flap, greater than 10 millimeters, this is something you’re going
to image sooner.</p>
<p>, generally within seven days. And as Dr. Kazi pointed out the other day
is that many of these patients are getting rescanned for lots of
different things. Reasons, whether it’s their blood organ , , solid
organ injuries and other things, and really kind of try and work it into
one of those or kind of fit the imaging , um, to help them out.</p>
<p>And then , um, if it’s an in, we’re gonna talk a little more about this
in detail, but if there is an external aortic contour abnormality,
generally, you’re going to repair that within less than one week. And
then of course, if the patient is hypotensive and has a hematoma , um,
concerning for a rupture, this should be repaired urgently.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> One of the things that comes up often I find is that.
Patients who ha who need to have their blood pressure elevated for one
reason or another such as a traumatic brain injury. And if you go back
on the behind the knife conversation , um, a couple of years ago, this
[00:11:00] was really brought to life as if they need to ramp up the
blood pressure to treat intracranial pathology.</p>
<p>Oftentimes that’s going to require a very urgent repair , um, so that,
that blood pressure can be brought up because you will not be able to do
that anti impulse therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Dark there. Are you saying on the, if there is a grade
one injury , um, per the say either, either guidelines, the Starns or
the SPS guidelines , , that you would this, if, and they needed a high
blood pressure for their brain, you’d potentially , , repair it with a T
VAR.</p>
<p>, even though there is no pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> That’s a great question. I think that Dr. Starnes
covered that a little bit and I’m not gonna speak too much on what he
said, but he found that the intimal terrors at 30 days in that podcast,
that they were not going to need to be re-imaged or repaired at all.</p>
<p>And so he put each of those patients on 325 milligrams of aspirin for 30
days and said in that podcast that he didn’t Ramage them. So in that
particular case, no, I would not repair an intimal. Tear. Um, but if it
was a [00:12:00] significant other type of aortic injury, I think I
would lean towards repairing that.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Dr. Rasmussen?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah , I, I agree. I think that , um, you know, the,
sort of the grade ones that, , the, the , um, Seattle group has
described,, I, I, I don’t think that they , um, You know, parsed out the
patients who might, for example, need a higher cerebral profusion
pressure. And therefore they, they’re not as amenable to , , you know,
anti impulse therapy or hypotensive, resuscitation, whatever.</p>
<p>I don’t think they really parse that out, but I don’t. I also don’t. I
also don’t think that they, you know, they th th that they recommend or
others around the country recommend, you know , um, Fixing grade one
injuries in, in those patients. I think that they’re, if they’re grade
one , Um, they, you know , those, those generally don’t need to be
treated.</p>
<p>And , , now, I mean, I think there’s always room as in all of these
complex situations for,, for, for another CT, you know , for, for a
followup CT to see, I mean, if , , if a provider’s really nervous about
it and , , you know, the. The neurosurgeons have had to drive up the
pressure for the [00:13:00] TBI or, , to, to maintain, , , CPP then,
then , um, you know, you can always image them again to confirm that.</p>
<p>But , , I agree. I think if, if they’re a grade one injury , um, right
now they, they, you know, non non-operative therapies is safe and
indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. So let’s talk a little bit more about the nitty
gritty of actually repairing these things. It’s important for , ,
residents out there to understand , , the T-bar devices that are
currently in the market.</p>
<p>Um, these are generally designed for aneurysmal disease and not for the
trauma population. , the Trump populations going to be smaller. They’re
going to be , um, Younger and healthier vessels and it’s , um, you know,
these devices weren’t really made. So the devices that we currently
have, they are, you know, generally require large diameter , , access.</p>
<p>Their compliance is not , , as ideal for these kinds of , , smaller
aortic arches. And the actual size of the devices are relatively large
compared to these aortas. Um, the average size of the aorta proximal to
the injury in a study was shown to be about 19 millimeters. And our
current smallest [00:14:00] device is about 22 millimeters, which is,
you know, an adequate oversizing, but you wouldn’t, you know, that’s , ,
only, you know, wouldn’t want much bigger than that.</p>
<p>So , , Dr. W what is your experience with the current generation of
devices?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the good news for a lot of these devices
is that the technology seems to be advancing. To where arch confirmation
is starting to have a lot of technological advances so that the young
patient with the steep aortic arch will better be treated in the coming
decade.</p>
<p>Dr. Rasmussen, this always brings up an interesting question in regards
to, so the sizing of an Intergraph, so in a patient’s injured and
they’re in the trauma Bay and they get their CT angiogram. Oftentimes
they’re under resuscitated. How do you go about assessing what you think
is the proper size of the order and choosing your endograft.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> So I think , um, it’s a great question. And , um,
one of the things just to add to what you’ve, what you’ve said , , Wayne
is that , um, and it really, I think fits with our , um, the, you know,
the line of our discussion about the evolution of, , of, of, not of this
injury pattern. Now our ability to [00:15:00] have classifications that
are pretty technical , , with degree of injury.</p>
<p>then the evolution of. Of management techniques is now the evolution of
these stent graphs. And, you know , um, one of the, I think things to
keep in mind is that. TEVAR for blunt threat , um, thoracic
endovascular, aneurysm repair T VAR extent graft , , for blunt aortic
injury, you know, a decade ago was done with really very clunky
endograft technology and none of that technology.</p>
<p>Let’s say for the, for example, the WST two study that I cited , , the ,
the, the endovascular repairs in that study were often , , you know,
iliac limbs , , for the, you know, not really designed for, for blunt
aortic injury. Now, fast forward to 2020. And we have, for example , ,
one of the devices that is made by Gore is actually has an indication ,
, for , , an aortic transduction.</p>
<p>You know, and so now , , you know , the, the technology , , is really
evolved now to, to suit the, you know, the condition, which is sort of
exciting. And I think gives us as vascular [00:16:00] surgeons and, and
gives patients a lot better options. Um, maybe we can go over some of
the specific devices , , next, your point, or your question about , um,
you know, imaging is, I think is, is.</p>
<p>Is an important one for listeners to understand. And I think w just to
be clear, what we’re talking about is is that if , , if , , Patient’s
aorta is imaged in the cat scanner when his or her systolic blood
pressure is 90 and they’re relatively hypovolemic then, you know , is,
is the , , how accurate is it has a diameter of 18 millimeters, for
example.</p>
<p>And is that a vasoconstrictive or just a hypovolemic , , aorta. And I
think it is, I think that it is, it is, it is not the greatest , ,
measure and that providers should To keep that in mind that when
patients are resuscitated, that the diameter of the aorta is actually
going to be larger. So usually what I would recommend is to , um, you
know, still oversize, , the, the stent graft by, you know, 20% or so
based on your original measurement , , again and here , , unlike
aneurysm disease [00:17:00] where you know, you’re trying to.</p>
<p>I think get a seal and it really diseased , um, and dilated aorta here.
, you know, the seals zone in, in the, in the pathology is, is almost
always much more focal. You’re really just trying to cover and seal the
proximal intimal tear. Um, and so I think that, you know, oversizing by
roughly 20% , um, Using intravascular ultrasound or IVUS, I think is
also useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you get them, the patient to the, or for the TVR, for the
thoracic endovascular repair, using intravascular ultrasound real time
to confirm or refute your original , um, you know, your original CT scan
is. Is , , is also useful. Um, but I think keeping in mind the blood
pressure and their volume status when the scan was taken oversizing by
somewhere around 20 to 25% and then using IVIS.</p>
<p>So I think are useful tips. What do you think, or how do you guys do it
in San Antonio? Oh, that’s a</p>
<p>great</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> point. I mean , we, we set up IVUS for every single
aortic case so that it can be there. It’s mounted to the system and.
[00:18:00] Even if we don’t use it for the particular case, we know that
everything’s there and available for us to use it.</p>
<p>If we need to re image or resize and aorta or some other blood vessels
so that it can be adequately sized. I remember one time we had a 17 year
old with a blunt traumatic aortic injury and he needed an emergent
repair and we didn’t have the smallest endograft at the hospital, but
fortunately there was a one from a local hospital that could be sent
over, but.</p>
<p>That was a little bit of a troubleshooting. I was, what is, what was I
going to do as far as putting a larger endograft into a relatively
smaller we’re to knowing exactly what we talked about that open repair
has much worse outcomes than an endovascular repair. And I think my, the
way I was going to approach that one was I was going to use the IVIS
after I deployed the endograft to make sure I didn’t have a retrograde
dissection , , or something , , some major complication related to the
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think, I think that also , , Wayne speaks to
the,, um, the,, in, in some ways, and I, I don’t want this [00:19:00] to
be not, I don’t want to overstate this, but in some ways this condition
is , um, although the overall patient complexity can be a much greater,
some ways, just the aortic. Pathology is simpler than, than a complex
dilated aortic aneurysm and in an elderly patient.</p>
<p>And, and I think that makes it more amenable to,, , to , um, you know,
sort of belts and suspenders repair, meaning that you just really need
to seal the, the entry point. I mean, again, it’s not, I’m not trying to
oversimplify it because it is serious. And these certainly , , some of
these, a grade three or four by imaging can certainly rupture and cause
mortality.</p>
<p>But, but even in the WST two trial in 2000, Eight that was published in
the journal of trauma, the success and the, in the unmistakable , ,
advantage of endo repair over open. That was all using very primitive,
endo materials, you know, as I mentioned , so, you know, I think,, ,
it’s really an exciting part of vascular , , practice mascular
[00:20:00] trauma is, is the evolution of , , of these technologies.</p>
<p>But , , I appreciate, and I agree with, and it definitely used them.
Belts and suspenders sorts of endograft that you got. It’s not exactly
the one you want. Um, but you use what you can and just try to seal the,
the proximal portion of the intimal tear.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. And , , you know, there, there’s a lot of
technical aspects of these and , , kind of , , you can miss , um, the
zone you can deploy to proximal, to distal.</p>
<p>One of the issues that comes up and you see sort of in a case reports of
, , you know, malpositioned , , devices is what they call bird beaking
and where the , um, the lesser curve, the graft isn’t. Approximated well
, um, to the lesser curve of the aorta and a doctor asked me, said, I
wonder if you had any tips for our listeners , um, on how to avoid a
bird beak.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. A couple of things. Um, so I
wish we could , , illustrate this , , for your listeners. Um, you did a
nice job bird beaking to me and , , you know, you guys jump in or
correct me if you’ve got a different way to articulate it. On just
[00:21:00] a call. We don’t have a whiteboard , um, bird beaking, as you
said, is the, is sort of the lifting of the inferior aspect of the very
proximal.</p>
<p>, endograft where the fabric is. That that, that ring, if you will, of
stent covered stent lifts up off of the inner curve of the aortic arch.
And if it lifts up, then it’s prone to get an, a, you know, the jet of
flow and pressure that then, you know, would cause an endo leak. And so
to get that first covered stent ring to lay down , , so that it doesn’t
lift up and cause this, I guess the bird beat comes, cause it sort of
has this appearance of a.</p>
<p>I’m a triangle , , on the, on the imaging, I guess that’s where bird big
comes from. Um, to get that, to lay down a couple of things, one , um, I
think getting a stiff wire , um, , , around the outer edge of the art.
So using an Amplatz , , or a lender, Quist wire, that’s really , um, all
the way into the aortic root, the ascending aorta and actually
[00:22:00] pushing it.</p>
<p>Um, so that it’s got sort of a constant. Tension that , um, allows you
to get the endograft forward and, you know, making sure that you have a
stiff wire and platform. Is one, you know , that’s, that’s a basic
principle of endograft deployment anyway, independent of the bird beak.
But I think that helps. And then I think another is to consider if
there’s, if it’s close or if it’s an angulated arch to consider taking
the endograft over, across the origin of the left subclavian artery ,
um, to where the , um, You know, to where the there’s more room, if you
will, and a flatter inner arch or inferior aspect of that curvature to
lay the graph down.</p>
<p>So covering the left subclavian, using a stiff wire with forward
pressure on that wire during positioning and deployment. And then the
third thing, you know, some of the, the Gore , , conformable , ,
Thoracic Intergraph now actually has a kind of a ratchet on it that,
that allows one to have some control of that first stent so that you can
actually kind of conform or lay it down.</p>
<p>Um, I think that that’s real. Um, [00:23:00] I’m not quite sure how
effective, I don’t know what, you know, Wayne, what you think about the
conformable Gore graft, but I think that maybe another advantage that
comes as graphs that you can actually. Manipulate them when they’re in
place and try to lay down that first , , covered stent component.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Right? I, I think that’s ideal. I mean, we have
recently. Switched all our inventory. So we let the old stuff, you know,
use it or, or expire. And then everything that we purchased now for
blunt, thoracic aortic injury is conformable. And I like to use the
double curve Lundquist. And just like you said, I. I have the assistant
, , whoever’s holding the wire actually put forward pressure.</p>
<p>So that, that wire is really snugged against the greater curvature of
the order aorta. And also that the double curve lender request is
basically sitting at the , , at the heart so that it can really give me
as much tension as I can. And I think that bringing it across less of
cleaving, if you think it’s going to be bird beak is, [00:24:00] is.</p>
<p>Absolutely essential that if you need to cover it so that you don’t have
it sitting oddly on the inner curvature, that that’s ideal. And I agree
with you a hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. So , , another kind of issue , , that we can
sometimes run into in our trauma patients is getting the devices there.
Um, some of the iliac arteries are , , relatively small.</p>
<p>Um, you know, granted the devices are getting smaller themselves, but
Dr. Rasmussen, do you have a size , , that you would consider doing an
Elliot conduit , , for these graphs? Is there kind of a rule of thumb
with our current generation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great idea. A great question. A great idea.
Sometimes to do it in Elliot conduit, if you need it.</p>
<p>I think , um, Boy, I hate to , , to wimp out and just say it depends.
Um, so I would say that, you know, if , if, if the iliac , um, but it
does, but it does depend , um, you know, it depends on the age of the
patient. I mean, if they’re calcium free , um, you know, it’s a young
patient, like many or most of our trauma patients , um, and the iliac
is, you know , um, Seven millimeters or greater.</p>
<p>Um, and it’s sort of a straight shot we’ll give it a try. seven.
[00:25:00] To eight millimeters is sort of on the small side of this.
Um, but I will often, but if it’s calcium free in, in a young patient,
then, you know, w w we’ll try it through the, through , , through the
femoral without a conduit.</p>
<p>Um, I think that if gets smaller than that, if it’s a female and they’re
hypotensive, when the images come through and you, you know, you’re
ultrasounding them in the, or using duplex to size up their common
femoral and you, you know, whether it’s shock or just they’re native,
they’re just small. If it gets to be, you know, less than six or seven
millimeters, then I think , , You know , , exposing either the common
femoral or the external iliac through retroparotoneil approach and
putting on a Dacron conduit is it’s easy enough , , and should be done.</p>
<p>Um, So it depends, but you know, the flip side, I guess , , Kevin is
that if it’s , , you know, if there’s a lot of calcium and it’s an
elderly patient and it looks like there’s atherosclerosis, then I have a
lower threshold to put on a conduit because you know, you could cause
problems. It’s not as accommodating of a passage of the sheet.</p>
<p>If they’re, if they’re calcified or [00:26:00] highly</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ambulant, Yeah, I think if it measures seven on the
seat, the angiogram and the trauma Bay, that it’s likely, like you said,
if it’s not calcified and not diseased and not injured, otherwise it’s,
it’s a good chance that you’re gonna be able to deliver that endograft
without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Um, you may, I sometimes consider, I use do a most percutaneously, but
cut down on the femoral artery, just like you said, just to make sure
that it’s delivered safely. And if there’s a problem with removing it,
that I’m ready to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that’s a great point. If it’s a small one
and you feel like you’re kind of right on that edge, then I have a low
threshold to just cut down.</p>
<p>And that way, you know, you afford yourself, I think a little bit , um,
more assured sort of placement sure. Placement with an open, which is
also relatively easy or should be, , to, to do it open the other. The
other thing, I don’t know if you’ve used, I sometimes will oil the
sheets with mineral oil, you know, I’ll put it on the.</p>
<p>On the , , I mean, you know, the other question here we haven’t really
talked about is heparin heparin eyes or not. We can get to that, but
sometimes I’ll get some mineral oil on the back, you know, and I’ll just
cover the sheath. If you think [00:27:00] it’s going to be tight and
sort of make that , um, make the sheath as you’re passing it from the
femoral up the, the small externally, like into the end of the AOR to
make it slick, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, you , , are reading our minds, sir. So I was
actually going to bring this question to Dr. Kazi. Um, many of these
patients are multi injured as we’ve discussed and have , , head
injuries, maybe even head bleeds. Um, do you recognize in all of these
cases, is there cases where you won’t</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> have her nice? Well, it’s interesting in our group, we
have a variation of practice patterns.</p>
<p>, I guess number one is if the neurosurgeon or someone. Completely
contraindicate you to using heparin. And then you’re a little bit in a
bind. I haven’t really found that to be largely the case, but it does
come up every now and then I personally like to Hep denies, even if it’s
just a little bit of heparin , um, 3000 of heparin, just to , , allow me
to have the optimal device, but I don’t think it’s necessary.</p>
<p>One of the things that you and I discussed recently because we repaired
A symptomatic AAA three days ago on a COVID positive patient. Kevin was,
we were concerned about the thrombosis [00:28:00] with the large sheets.
Um, Dr. Rassman, what do you think with the COVID patients , um, and
heparin in general , , do you, do you have denies all of your T VARs and
what ha what if you had a COVID positive patient?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question. I mean, I think , um, You
know , I, I remember , um, my first sort of TVRS for blunt aortic injury
when I was in San Antonio and I was amazed at , um, how. Um, if the
patient’s condition allows it , , and I think most of them do , ,
operative planning. So imaging , , trying to get some resuscitation,
maybe even, you know, a 12 to 24 hour delay and the repair.</p>
<p>If you get everything lined up and it’s a straightforward , , repair ,
um, how you, you can really get these stent grafts in and. Sort of 30
minutes or less. Um, I don’t, I don’t want to exaggerate or tell a fish
story here. So I , , you know, I know it’s never as quick as we surgeons
think it is, but the point is if you can get it done quickly and the
patient has other , , contraindications, a head bleed, solid organ
injury, you know, big hematoma and a fractured femur or [00:29:00]
something, then I think they can be done safely without heparin.</p>
<p>Um, and I think , um, one just needs to be mindful of the time. Um, and
then really flushing out the femoral and then assessing the access side
or site , , when you’re done. Um, so I think they can be done safely
without heparin. Um, now the, the flip side is if the patient has no
solid organ injury, TBI hematoma, and the thigh from a femur fracture ,
then, then proceeding with the use of heparin is it would be preferred.</p>
<p>You know, I think that’s always preferred. Um, so I think, you know, I
guess what I would say is I would prefer to use heparin. I do in all the
cases that I can , , but I don’t sweat it too much if I can’t, because
of other conditions, the patient has other injuries. I just am more
attentive to the time my sheets are in.</p>
<p>And then to what’s happened. What’s the status of the Elio femoral
segment. After I’ve removed the sheets. I think in COVID positive
patients, I think they’ve shown [00:30:00] themselves to be relatively
hypercoagulable and I would , , I would want to I’d, you know, I I’d
have a more , um, you know , , th I think the imperative to
anticoagulate coagulate, those patients would be higher because of their
, , shown propensity to develop , , thrombus.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, that’s exactly what Kevin and I did with that
endo AAA patient is we pepper to them more than we normally would. And
then followed act pretty closely to make sure they stayed over two 50,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> a really good point. And we didn’t really mention
it, but the act, the activated clotting time, I think, you know, we
talked about operative planning and, you know, for your listeners, I
think.</p>
<p>You know, we tell our trainees the best, the best resident, the best
surgeons are pessimists. You know, it sounds bad. I don’t want to be a
downer before the holidays, but you have to anticipate things going
wrong and never be the optimist. Right. , if I have a major injury or
condition, I want my doctor to be worried that everything’s going to go
wrong.</p>
<p>, I’m exaggerating a little bit to make the point. The part of that is
the act machine. Like how many times have we been in the employment? And
we need an activated clotting time because we really, whether it’s for
carotid or endarterectomy or this type of an [00:31:00] injury, and you
know, the, our staff, our anesthesia colleagues, not necessarily to a
fault of theirs, they’ll say, Oh, we don’t basically team.</p>
<p>Machine’s not working. Or we don’t have it or something. Right. So part
of the pre-op planning for, for house officers is, you know, among all
the other things is where’s the act machine. And could we draw a test
act before the case starts because Dr. Kazi really needs the act on this
one. And , um, the last time you, you know, the worst time to hear ,
well, the act machine is not available.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work. Cause when you’ve got a, you know, an 18 French sheath
up a small iliac and an undergrad in the order, So I agree with the act
and , , I don’t want to sound too much like a pessimist. Maybe I’m just
a realist , um, that, you know, putting that on the pre-op timeout, for
example, if you’re going to do team steps or time out , , make sure that
you’re you’re you got that act lined up.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. , so there’s two kind of main points
we want to cover here , , to wrap up , topic. And one of them is the
subclavian artery. And as we discussed before, the average distance
between the injury and [00:32:00] a subclavian is about 5.8 millimeters.
And most of these devices recommend a two centimeter coverage and
healthy vessel.</p>
<p>Um, and then two centimeters distal in order to adequate coverage. so.
And , and, and using those numbers, the registry suggests about 40% of
patients have their subclavians covered in these cases. So, Dr.
Rasmussen, what are your thoughts on covering subclavian artery? Do you
, um, do anything to revascularize it AF if you do , , cover it and any,
any thoughts you have on this?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. this also has evolved , , and
I think can be institution specific. Although I think most institutions
now have gone to not. ,, um, preemptively, revascularizing the
subclavian. So maybe for, if we take a step back , , I don’t want to
take too much time, but I think for your listeners, what we’re talking
about here is , is, is covering with that covered stent.</p>
<p>So you’ve got to get that covered stent graft up over. In into the
distal part of the aortic arch to seal to [00:33:00] get a good two
centimeter length of seal before that aortic tear that happened most
commonly at the aortic isthmus. Right. And so sometimes that requires
covering the left subclavian artery. And while that seems crazy, most
patients do just fine with that.</p>
<p>Actually they may have a little bit of arm claudication, but do just
fine. And what that allows us to do is to then get that two centimeters
of seal. , where the stent graph is really well. Well, opposed to the
inner curve of the aortic arch, if you will, , or, or the outer curve.,
the, the things that I think about, I think , , where’s the vertebral
artery.</p>
<p>So the, so the risks of covering the left side, Clarion, I mentioned arm
, , arm claudication , um, or Ms. Schema, so real close attention to , ,
and then another complication could be stroke. Right. So that , um, if ,
if, if the patient has, , , the dominant vertebral artery is on the left
and it comes off the left subclavian, and for some reason they don’t
have a right to vertebral, then you really need to revasc you’ve got to,
you can’t cover the left subclavian without [00:34:00] revascularizing.</p>
<p>Um, you know , um, that subclavian and the verge , um, so paying
attention to where the w what the, the dominant vert is, where it’s
from, what is the right vertebral artery look like? Is there
atherosclerotic disease in the arch and the great vessels to include the
birds? And then the third main complication is spinal cord ischemia ,
um, and weirdly , , you know, for your listeners, you think , well, how
can covering the left subclavian lead to spinal cord ischemia?</p>
<p>Um, and if you. Think back to how our spinal cord is perfused. Um, it is
rare in a very it’s uncommon , but, but there are collateral pathways
through the, through the Ima, the internal mammaries and to, through
other,, , collateral circulations that originate off the subclavian.
Whereas subclavian profusion can be important to perfuse the spine.</p>
<p>So, you know, Making sure that you have those three things in mind, left
arm, claudication, posterior circulation, stroke, spinal cord ischemia.
And as long as you have those front and center , um, you know, most of
the time you can still cover that left subclavian [00:35:00] without.
Revascularizing it. And you will be cognizant of the situations where
you do need to revascularize it either before you do the T bar or at the
same time.</p>
<p>Um, or sometimes afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, this is always an interesting situation,
particularly some more rare scenarios that often comes up as well as , ,
as you said, the right for T-ball already may be occluded. There’s a
dialysis access and the left arm or the one that concerns me the most is
if there’s a Lima to an LA , , I don’t, I agree. I agree.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s an easy answer on these. , we have , , laser
finished rated a few endograft for these rare cases with pretty good
result. And I do think that there’s some graphs on the horizon. That’s
going to allow us to preserve that left subclavian artery , um, in the</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> future. Really good point about the Lima. So for the
listeners, that means that the patient’s had a cabbage and they’ve got
their eyes left. Ima going into the, for example, anterior , , or to
the, into a coronary. So you can’t, you know, you can’t cover that
without you might cause a M I, [00:36:00] And I think good point on the
future of the graphs, I think we do have already branch graphs that , ,
may not yet be approved for trauma, but they’re probably coming, which
will help.</p>
<p>And did we talk about, or maybe I’ll ask a question. I don’t know if
that’s fair. , , Kevin and Wayne, but did we talk about spinal cord
drainage? I mentioned, you know, spinal cord ischemia and a rare
incidence in paraplegia, you know, do you guys , , in San Antonio
preemptively , , do spinal cord drainage , , for blunt aortic injuries
that you’re going to put an undergrad in or not?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> , no. Um, in general, it’s thought that , , likely due
to the short distance of coverage with these graphs, that there’s not a
lot of , , intercostals that are kind of covered and putting the spinal
cord at risk. I think the, the risk of spinal cord ischemia is extremely
low in these cases, but it’s something you certainly.</p>
<p>Have to have in mind and have your anesthesia team or neurosurgery
colleagues , um, aware of and available for , , should the situation
change. And so certainly a motor in [00:37:00] neuro exam at the
conclusion of the case is critical. And I think we would respond , ,
with , , elevating the blood pressures and , um, you know, potentially
placing a spinal drain if there was concern for , , spinal cord ischemia
, , following the case, but , , routinely , , we do not.</p>
<p>um , And, and that’s sort of our kind of algorithm for that. How about
you, Dr. Mucin?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I agree. I don’t have a whole lot more to add.
We do it selectively very uncommonly and that’s also because of the
risks associated with , , placing a spinal cord drain. You know, those
aren’t minimal both placing the drain and then monitoring it
effectively.</p>
<p>Um, I think we’ve got away from that. I think it is important for your
listeners to understand also that. And I think you referred to this,
that the risk of spinal cord ischemia, when you cover, you know, a
segment of the, of the, of the descending thoracic aorta, the risk is
low because we’re not paving the entire or such a long segment.</p>
<p>But the risk is , , you know, it’s out there for what, 24 hours, 48
hours. So there’s a rare, you know, again, thinking about being a
[00:38:00] pessimist , , I guess I should get away from that term. That
sounds bad around the holidays. I’m not trying to be , , but you know,
the resident’s house officers, you have to realize that, that the
patients who, for example, come out of the, or with a normal neuro exam,
there is an incidence it’s low to 3%.</p>
<p>But patients who can develop spinal cord ischemia like 24 or 48 hours or
even 72 hours later. So we really have to be mindful of, of the spinal
cord ischemia complication, even though it’s uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the post-operative care can’t be
understated. The fact that you avoid hypotension, you make sure that the
patient’s properly resuscitated.</p>
<p>And if there is any concern for a neurologic , , event that’s occurring,
that you have a system in place to where a lumbar drain can be placed
relatively expeditiously. A couple of things that come to mind. When I
think about spinal drains, particularly for elective cases are someone
who’s had a priority repair , , Chronic [00:39:00] kidney disease to a
significant degree, stage four or five, or even in stage renal disease.</p>
<p>And , um, and whether I’m going to need to cover a large segment. And
luckily for most aortic injuries, you’re talking 10 centimeters for a
covered endograft. And so again, that’s going to be the, the shortest
device that’s available. And so it’s going to give you the lowest risk.
As far as an aortic coverage standpoint occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> those are great points and things to keep in mind when
, , fixing these patients. , so as we wrap up a blunt, thoracic aortic
injury, we’re going to cover one of the more important points. There’s a
lot of important points here. , but this one , , is the timing of the
repair. Um, You know, generally it was thought initially that, you know,
you should repair these sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Um, but Dr. Rasmussen, , what, what are your thoughts on the timing?
And, and specifically, I think we’re referring to the, kind of the, the
SVS grade three, the pseudo aneurysms, , what, what are your thoughts on
the timing of repair of these.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Um, so another great topic, great question in this,
, , pertaining to this injury pattern.</p>
<p>I think that , um, you know, I think that I’ll start with the premise
that [00:40:00] delayed repair is, is certainly feasible. Um, in many
cases and in. Many cases it’s preferable. And so , um, that’s sort of
the premise of , of, of the answer and delayed repair, meaning 24 to 48
hours later is feasible and preferable in many cases.</p>
<p>Um, I want to be careful because there’s certainly some cases , , where
it’s, you know , , a grade four or a grade three that’s, that’s evolving
into a four , , where the patient, you know, the delayed repair is not.
Feasible, , um, but I think that Delaine w what we’ve understood, I
think with our experience broadly on this , um, in the U S is that once
you get a patient under your.</p>
<p>Care in, into your ICU. If they have a grade three repair and they’ve
survived that far and you now can get them on anti impulse therapy, um ,
and, and appropriate resuscitation, that, that waiting 24 hours again is
safe and, and preferable. , and I think the majority of cases,, and, and
why is that?</p>
<p>Well, I think it’s because it allows us to do good. [00:41:00] Operative
planning. We’ve, we’ve mentioned sort of the team steps, if you will,
the things that we want to troubleshoot and anticipate for the repair ,
, whether it’s size of vessel access assembling the right endograft the
right team to include spinal cord drainage or what, you know, the whole
thing.</p>
<p>I think we do a better job. We’re giving ourselves 24 to 36 hours, for
example. And I think it also allows patients other injuries to be
stabilized. So whether that’s a serious TBI , um, you know, long bone
fracture, solid organ injury, , , I think it, it helps us. So , um, so I
think Delaine is, is , is, is feasible.</p>
<p>We’ve just published. I, we mentioned. Well mentioned a whole lot of
papers here, but , , there is a paper in the journal of vascular surgery
, , that is a large assessments and just came out in the journal of
vascular surgery, Ramon. , is the senior author, Dr. most of you know,
is that you, the university of Texas health science center, and it’s a
great paper for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>It’s, it’s the timing of repair for blunt aortic injuries. So it’s this
[00:42:00] paper addresses exactly your question. Um, it’s a great paper
cause it’s got a trauma and vascular surgeons on it. , Bryan Eastridge,
Don Jenkins are on it. , but it’s got some really , , awesome , ,
vascular surgery fellows from Cleveland clinic who did this when they
were in Cleveland.</p>
<p>, and what that analysis of the national trauma DataBank shows is, is
just that is that it’s actually a survival benefit associated with
delayed repair. Um, and I won’t go into the paper. Your readers can look
at JBS and, and Ramon, Dr. , , , is you can sort of pub met him, or we
can send that paper out on your, on your , , to your listeners , but,
but it does show that there’s a survival benefit for those who have a
greater than 24 hour.</p>
<p>, delay in their TVR. And that’s, there’s an analysis that we did in
that paper that, that controls for severity of injury, you know, meaning
that it’s not just because those with less severe injuries , um, survive
longer. there’s undoubtedly some survivor ship. Bias and that , ,
definitely acknowledged that, but it, but that paper speaks to its at
large NTDB [00:43:00] analysis of this injury and it speaks to the,
value of , of, of trying to delay repair if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a really important , , topic , um,
to have published the data on, because I think many surgeons and ER docs
, and, and when they hear of a aortic transection or pseudo aneurysm
feel , um, and they may pressure , , vascular surgeons to, you know, get
in there and fix it. And I think , , knowing this information is
critical and supportive of our community.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> And the, and the delay also allows you to. Really get
an idea of what’s the constellation of the Andrew patterns that are
occurring. I mean , if, if there’s some infectious process that’s
concomitantly going on with the injured patient’s care that can an
infected endograft and the thoracic order can be a nearly.</p>
<p>If not insurmountable problem to try to tackle and , , repair. Um, we, I
can remember one case where the endograft was infected and before we
could even wrap our hands around it, the aorta had ruptured and the
patient ended up succumbing to their injuries. But[00:44:00] , , th th
delaying it by a little bit of time affords you the opportunity to
really gather as much information as you can, to make the best decision
on when and how to prepare the aorta.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. And some of the delays, I mentioned 24 hours,
but I think Wayne is you’re pointing out. It can also be seven days,
right. It can be, you know, as long as no, the thing is that, you know,
you can’t ignore the patient, you got to still stick with anti impulse
therapy.it’s , and you know, very meticulous care cause you can.</p>
<p>You know, there are cases certainly where a delay, you know, can fail,
you know, and those are cases where we lose track of their blood
pressure and, and , , you know, something happens in the, or for a femur
fracture or something, and we lose track and , , we’re not communicating
as a multidisciplinary team and you can turn a stable.</p>
<p>, you know, grade three injury that you’re observing for four, three or
four or five days into one that ruptures that’s were very rare. But
again , , we want to be mindful of, of , , just because we’re delaying
doesn’t mean you get a free pass until the, or, and , , five [00:45:00]
days</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> later. Right? I think if I may, personally, if I’m
going to be watching.</p>
<p>, grade three aortic injury , um, up to seven days that patient’s going
to stay in the ICU with very close monitoring that entire time until the
time of the repair.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> These are fantastic points. And I think we really
covered blunt, thoracic aortic injury , , quite in depth. And I think
our listeners will really enjoy this.</p>
<p>We have two more topics that are much briefer to cover here as we close
out the endovascular management of trauma. Um, so we’re gonna move down
the order a little bit. We’re going to do below the diaphragm, and this
is pretty rare, but there are. Important to keep this in mind. Um, the
blunt abdominal aortic injuries in the endovascular approach to this.</p>
<p>Um, so many times it’s a similar sort of patient population as the , ,
thoracic aortic injuries , , where it’s a multiple injured trauma. And
when we described the blunt abdominal work injury, they in, in repairing
it for endovascular, there’s three zones that are thought of , um, and
the numbers ones, and three are the ones that you can repair , um,
endovascular.</p>
<p>So the zone one is from the diaphragm down to the SMA. Um, zone
[00:46:00] two is the SMA and renal arteries are relatively small
segment, but , , that’s the zone two. And then zone three is from the
inferior renal inferior to the renal arteries, to the aortic
bifurcation. Um, so. Zone one and zone three, you know, above , , from
above the SMA two.</p>
<p>And then also below the renal arteries are the two areas that are
amenable to endovascular repair.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah. Fortunately, Kevin, these things are
extraordinarily uncommon. I mean, most vascular surgeons at level one
trauma centers, I would wager can count on one or two hands, depending
on how old they are. The number of these injuries they’ve had to manage
from an endovascular standpoint.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Rasmussen, what do you think about coverage of the celiac
artery? Um, and what are the factors you think about if you had to
prepare something in that area?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think that , um, I think there’s increasing
, um, literature, including I think , , an article and I’m just, won’t
pull the journal here, but I think it’s.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s this November , , JVs about the feasibility and safety of
covering the celiac artery it’s [00:47:00] what’s in this month. JBS is
not pertaining to trauma, but it’s talking about , , covering the celiac
for , , for T VAR EMR, for example, for aneurysm disease. I think we’re
learning that you can cover the celiac safely.</p>
<p>In many cases, I think it, it reminds me of what the left subclavian was
10 years ago. No, no, we were a little nervous. We knew there were some
patients you couldn’t cover it in. And now 10 years later, we pretty
routinely covered that left subclavian. , and I think the celiac artery
is similar. It reminds me of that.</p>
<p>I think in patients, obviously you’ve got to look at the make sure
they’ve got and SMA , , probably an Ima and then internal iliac
arteries, you know, looking at the blood supply to the whole of their
mesentery. And if any of that’s compromised, then that would give me.
Um, you know, pause, certainly if they’ve had a, you know, a gastrectomy
here or some unusual intra-abdominal operation, that’s interrupted their
bowel.</p>
<p>If you will, the gut circulation that would give me pause to cover the
celiac. Um, you know, but otherwise I think if it really gets you out of
a [00:48:00] jam , , which these injuries are like, so yeah, you’re
right. Wayne, they’re pretty rare, but man , they’re, they’re really
hard to. Try to repair open. So that gets a person out of a jam and you
need to cover the celiac.</p>
<p>I think he can.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. I think those are fantastic points. And, you
know, just like with the , , thoracic injuries and other, you know,
situation where you have to be prepared to respond , um, with a bypass,
potentially if, if , um, you know, you have a schema that you didn’t
expect. Um, and so it’s just things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>And one thing I think the we like talked about here is the IVIS is also
very helpful. It’s kind of like a, with. Dissection cases. A lot of
these cases are sort of , um, kind of variants of dissections of, of the
traumatic. And so the IVIS can really help characterize this. You can
help identify these large intimal flaps , um, in pseudo aneurysms or , ,
kind of, and see the branches and help plan your stint graft placement
all with IVIS.</p>
<p>So, So, one thing to keep in mind when, especially if these patients
might not tolerate a lot of contrasts and other kind of situation to
keep in mind, this is an, a patient with significant Tesla. Intestinal
contamination , , the endovascular approach to this [00:49:00] would
help , , eliminate any or. You know, minimize any risk of contamination.</p>
<p>, so Dr. Kazi, as far as the types of graphs , um, that you’re thinking
of when you have a patient , , what are you using? Are you using Tavarez
covered since Eric cuffs? What’s your preferred method?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred method is to use whatever. Means is going
to cover the least amount of aorta, but still seal the injury.</p>
<p>Um, so the answer to that is, yes, I I’d use all of them. Um, some of
the newer covered balloon expandable and post dilatable stints have
changed our management, particularly in the smaller aorta is at our
level one trauma center. We carry. Basically the entire catalog of
balloon expandable coverage stents.</p>
<p>, one that Kevin recently showed me , um, was we did an iliac branch
case last week and the , , covered stent. I didn’t realize started up.
It started eight millimeters and goes all the way up to 11. I’m sorry.
16 millimeters. Previously, it was a 11 millimeter stent that could be
post dilated up to 16. So in the smaller aorta is , , I think these have
a role , um, and being able to post dilate them.</p>
<p>The [00:50:00] question is how to keep it in place when you’re post
dilating it so that it doesn’t move. And so if that’s a concern, then
oftentimes I will go to a, , , thoracic graft or an aortic cuff or , ,
something that I know is going to deploy and stay stable the entire
time.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> And I think , , now we’re going to move into our final
topic of the day is XLO sub cleaving injuries and endovascular
management.</p>
<p>We chose these three topics is endovascular care has really kind of in
some ways revolutionized , , the management of these. And so , um, as we
know the injuries to the XL, subclavian is very rare. And it’s likely
due to the protective nature of the skeleton, but the fact of the
skeleton there also makes it very difficult to obtain proximal and
distal control.</p>
<p>So , , Dr. Kazi, if you have a patient with some kind of contained some
Flavian injury , um, and you’re going to approach this from an
endovascular approach , , H w what approach do you prefer to, to access
this.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred approach is from the arm, if at
[00:51:00] all possible , um, that could either be brachial or radio.</p>
<p>Um, depending on the, again, if you have a covered stent that can be
post dilated to a size that can be delivered through a seven French
sheath, and you can use a, a radial access for those patients in that ,
, Can be done percutaneously with low risk. Otherwise I do like to cut
down on the brachial artery, if I’m , um, going to the brachial artery
for trauma just seems to be more reliable for me and sometimes even
quicker.</p>
<p>But, , I, I like the brachial approach, but sometimes I’ll do both the
brachial and the femoral approach , , and combine that with a through
wire. If I have a really tough or challenging aortic arch and I need to
deliver something. Say to the proximal, right. Subclavian. Um, and
you’ve got , , a type three arch or something to that effect.</p>
<p>And I liked the through wire.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. And so as far as you know, like discussing our
stint options here, and I I’ve heard , , debates even on Twitter about
this, about whether to use a self-expanding scent, because it might give
you more flexibility, especially if it’s in the axillary artery , um,
versus balloon expandable , um, more precise [00:52:00] deployment,
especially if near kind of branch vessels.</p>
<p>Um, Dr. SBS. And do you have a, do you have a preferred stint or do you
just base it on the situation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that we , um, had , , you know, I think
initially we aired. Um, and well, I don’t know, we erred on the side of
self-expanding initially, if you think back , um, you know, when we
first started treating this injury pattern with endo techniques covered
stents, all of the covered stents available were self-expanding.</p>
<p>We didn’t really have , um, you know, 10, 15 years ago, we didn’t have
viable , um, Balloon expandable covered stents. And so I think, you
know, therefore that’s what we got used to, whether it was the via Bon
or the old fluency or whatever the self-expanding. And so we got used to
that and I think more recently in the last three to four, five years , ,
there’s now , um, really nice balloon expandable covered stents, which
are flexible, I think it’s dealer’s choice in a lot of ways. I do think
there is truth to , um, balloon expandable for more precise landing. You
know, I just think that [00:53:00] premise of stenting is holds true,
meaning that if you gotta really nail something , , you know, close to a
Lima an internal mammary , um, for you read in relation to the
vertebral.</p>
<p>Um, you know, blue expandable is I think more accurate if it’s , , more
distally and needed in a longer stand in the axilla than using a
self-expanding is just fine. Another thing that, you know, I think you
may get to, but sometimes there’s you need to come from both right.</p>
<p>The arm, retro grade. Um, but if he can’t retrograde, you know,
sometimes coming antegrade , um, for imaging and sometimes to , to, to
really make that connection between the disruption but coming from the
groin into the. Origin of the subclavian axillary , , antegrade is, is
needed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> one of my techniques for that was to have a through
wire. So I had snare wire and the descending thoracic aorta. especially
for challenging arch. Then I would come across with a sheath from the
femoral artery and then deploy my stint with a through wire. Um, and
that I felt, gives me a pretty [00:54:00] precise deployment , ,
particularly if I’m really trying to nail something.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that there’s no curves or bends and that the
stent delivery. Which is usually a little stiffer than the sheath is
going to be able to make it around and be very precise. Particularly if
you’re trying, like you said, nail on a vertebral artery or , um, and
Ima</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> yeah, we had one where we, our last one we did here,
a couple of my partners are pretty crafty and skilled and, and we, we
actually had to put us , , we had to, I think we used a snare, right.</p>
<p>from the arm. We couldn’t get , , the wire to make the approach. So we
put a aim up, you know, antegrade through the lifts of Clayton, got a
snare sort of out there, and we’re able to snare the free wire and bring
it through. That’s pretty rare, pretty uncommon. Um, but you know , , I
think those are all techniques that we’re learning , , for the, kind of
the fringes of these injury patterns, which used to be too severe for us
to treat with endo.</p>
<p>And now we’re actually finding with technology and experience that
actually you can, you can treat the vast majority of these. [00:55:00]</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. These are , , A lot, a lot of options and things
are going to continue to evolve as our technology improves. It’s kind of
a theme of this episode. ,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> I seem to find that when people have these injuries
there, for some reason that maybe this is just my own experience, it
seems to be that they’re more contra-indicated for anticoagulation.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because the , , nature of the injury to injure
something in the, you know, in the. Bony thorax, such as scapulothoracic
dissociation or a sub claiming artist, pseudo aneurysm. I remember I can
remember there’s cases where the central line goes in for a head injured
patient because they need to monitor their CVPs.</p>
<p>Um, I prefer to have a brachial open approach to that. And when I can’t
give anticoagulation, just because I can, then I’m set up to do an
embolectomy if need be for the brachial artery.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, I think that, I think that’s a great point. And
just wrap this up, and as far as discussing, you know, options you have
from the endovascular approach, there really it’s up to your
imagination.</p>
<p>, , you know , , whether it’s [00:56:00] approximate rights of Cleveland
injury, approximal, left, subclavian and injury. Um, you know, you can
use a hybrid approach. I I’ve seen multiple examples of , , large
hematomas where , , proximal, distal control are obtained , , whether
it’s over a three wire from the arm.</p>
<p>Um, and then you can approach it open. Um, it really helps in that
situation. Um, I know , , recently we had a case where we did some
parallel stinting of the brachiocephalic in order to, to treat injury.,
and, and you can even use , , the approach to embolize. You can embolize
the subclavian arteries , um, and you know, and do things , , with.</p>
<p>As long as you’re respecting the people already. So , , keep in mind,
you know, there’s not one kind of recipe for treating these exits of
Cleveland injuries , um, and really kind of adjusting it to the patient.
you know, kind of the last thing I’ll mention is , , sometimes these
patients, you know, would probably do better with a bypass, especially
with some axillary artery injuries.</p>
<p>You know, it’s going to be in a pretty mobile spot , , but they’re too
sick. And so , , I’ve seen it even done where they use a stint graph to
temporize things, to keep inline flow. And then at a more stable time,
maybe a week, a month later, take them back and perform the bypass</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> [00:57:00] before you end. I don’t want to get you ,
, let you off the hook.</p>
<p>I think the question for you guys and your listeners and , and, and this
may be the most important question of our discussion is to what degree
does it, should we in the military? Try to take these endo technologies
into our deployed hospitals. Um, we’ve just discussed a range of
injuries in which patients do better.</p>
<p>Right? So they bleed less. They’re often less , , less frequently
paralyzed from T-bar for example , , they survive more, they , , with
these endo technologies. So are we telling ourselves that that’s okay
for civilians off the street in the U S. , but not good enough. , but,
but our, what our service members have to just kind of get by and the
deployed range.</p>
<p>Do you know when they’re down range with these injuries or is it our
responsibility to develop systems of casualty care in which we can take
these technologies down range? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s a great point. I mean , um,
Obviously the farther [00:58:00] out you get. So like when I was in a
Ford surgical team in Afghanistan, we, it took us three months to get ,
um, the most primitive x-ray machine you could think of.</p>
<p>And just to get a chest x-ray to see if there was a pneumothorax. But
when you get back to the rural three , um, level, which for everyone,
for the listeners, that’s a combat support hospital. So there were, for
instance, there would be one in Baghdad. So there’s one that triages to
the next level of care from all the forward surgical teams to a combat
support hospital.</p>
<p>There’s, there’s two in Afghanistan, for instance, but , um, They don’t
are always equipped with endovascular technologies as Dr. Rasmussen’s
really alluding to. And as a matter of fact, there, there are going to
be no thoracic endo to repair there’s. Um, the capabilities is digital
subtraction angiography. Um, usually it best to say, you know, treat a
bypass.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I do think that one of the things we brought up in this
podcast and Dr. Brass means I’d be interested in your, your thoughts is
that we have demonstrated that there is a delayed [00:59:00] timing of
repair for a Arctic injuries. And I do think that deployment and placing
an, a thoracic endograft or a covered stent.</p>
<p>In say Germany, Walter Reed or San Antonio is much better than trying to
do the same thing in Baghdad or bog room or Kandahar Afghanistan,
because , um, there are the, a septic techniques are not going to be the
same there as they are here. And the bacteria and the microorganisms
that exist in those environments are also significantly different than
what we experienced in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a great question. And, you know,
I kinda, I get a little bit fired up about it. Um, I know you’ve got a
lot of young, you know , you’ve, you’ve guys got the future , , who are
your listeners? You know, and I think there there’s a ton of , um, brain
power, you know, intellectual capacity that listens to this , , and it’s
to your guys’s credit.</p>
<p>I think it’s, it’s going to be up to, to the next generation, right. To
figure out. How do we integrate , , endo [01:00:00] technologies for
wartime scenarios and , um, you know, and I think to it’s , it’s, it’s
like it’s too big of a topic to answer that with one question. But I
think if you take it in , in, in, in sort of intervals and you say ,
well, in the near term, right?</p>
<p>So from now to 2022, 2023, Maybe all we can do is get like what you
said, Wayne. Let’s make sure we have vascular go teams on the West coast
and the East coast. , who can go into the Pacific or the European
theater, African theater , , with endo stuff. Right? So that if, if we
can’t get a casually back, we can , um, you know, figure out what we can
do in the near term.</p>
<p>But, you know, in the, in the, in the midterm, whose fault is it that
there’s no digital subtraction NGO to rule three? Is that, do we just
going to blame it on the system and say, it’s a damn shame. Where is
that our fault? Right. Cause we’re not articulating this. And I think,
you know , we, we should think about that.</p>
<p>I think that, yes. , so you know, most of the time a covered stent for
sure. Yeah, absolutely. Wayne. I mean, you’d definitely rather have a
T-bar and, you know, Germany or , , [01:01:00] Walter Reed or bamse
than, than in Ballade or Bodrum, Afghanistan, for example. But some
patients can’t wait. Right. And so. You know, how do we establish an
endo specific trauma inventory and get it into the cash?</p>
<p>Right? So the, for the select cases who can’t wait, what if it’s a type
three or type four , , blunt, aortic injury, do we then commit that
service member to, you know, an antiquated treatment, maybe , , if it’s
a one cause, and it’s particularly relevant in this discussion, because
you’ve mentioned injury patterns that can be highly lethal, but are
particularly amenable.</p>
<p>To end of therapies, you know, and there’s no answer to it. And I don’t
mean to get too fired up, but I, I’m excited to sort of pose that
question to the young and innovative, you know, listeners that you guys
have to help us think about. What does a trauma specific endo inventory,
how can it be brought to, you know, resource limited circumstances or
scenarios to, to provide the benefit that these technologies have to
some of these patients.</p>
<p>It’s great discussion. And [01:02:00] I really appreciate the
opportunity to spend some time with, , , with you guys. , and, and , ,
it’s been fun.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. And doctor asked me to sing. You have to
thank you for this entire series for joining us and taking time out of
your very busy schedule to get down and dirty and talk very specific and
very technical.</p>
<p>Um, I think this will be a resource for years to come for both the
listeners of behind the knife and audible bleeding. So thank you. Thank
you again, and thank you, Dr. Kazi for joining us and helping us with
this discussion. Yeah. Thanks</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Stay safe and stay well.</p>
