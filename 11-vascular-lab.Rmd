```

So let's start with an overview of ultrasound modalities, waveforms, and
changes proximal and distal to flow-limiting stenosis.

## **Overview**

**Brief overview of ultrasound:** Ultrasonography uses [sound
waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave) with
[frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) higher than those
audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending pulses of
ultrasound into [tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology))
using a
[probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_transducer#Use_in_medicine).
Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many
types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular
ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:

**B-mode (Brightness) imaging** is a 2-D, black and white display of
tissue [acoustic
impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_impedance)s.

**Doppler mode** uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize blood
flow.

**Spectral Doppler** converts frequency shifts from moving blood to
velocities using the Doppler equation and displays a "spectrum" of these
frequencies as Doppler waveforms.

**Color Doppler** presents velocity information as a color-coded overlay
on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term commonly used
for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler data. Of note,
when looking at a still image of a color flow duplex, the color may be
misleading for direction because it may not be noted at which part of
the cardiac cycle the picture was taken. It is far more reliable to look
at the spectral doppler waveform.

**Power Doppler** is less frequently used, but is based solely on
amplitude of the doppler signal without giving information on direction.
This is particularly useful to detect certain low or abnormal flow
states, such as testicular/ovarian torsion, carotid string sign, slow
intrarenal flow, supporting occlusion seen on B-mode or
color.[@pellerito2019]

### Waveforms

**What do normal spectral waveforms look like?**

[Normal spectral waveforms]{.underline} have a brisk upstroke, sharp
peak, rapid downstroke. A "spectral window" under the waveform, that is
the black space between the spectral waveform and the 0 velocity axis,
represents the absence of lower velocities - indicative of laminar flow
within the vessel (Image 1: normal spectrum waveform)

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide2.png"))

```

**How can we differentiate low vs high resistance waveforms?**

Waveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal
vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver,
spleen, peripheral muscle during exercise, and postprandial SMA have
constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low resistance
vascular beds. [Low resistance waveforms]{.underline} for arteries
supplying these organs demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the
cardiac cycle because the distal bed being supplied has low resistance
leading to high end-diastolic flow.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide3.png"))

```

In contrast, [high resistance waveforms]{.underline} are seen for
arteries supplying resting peripheral muscles, fasted mesenteric beds
(such as the fasting SMA), and the external carotid artery. High
resistance waveforms are characterized by triphasic morphology, with a
sharp peak, early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow (elastic
recoil of the artery, and then no flow during the remainder of the
diastolic phase.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide4.png"))

```

**How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?**

First let's define [Stenosis:]{.underline} A hemodynamically significant
stenosis (area reduction \>50%) will result in a doubling of velocity
from the inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio
\>2).

**Now what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?**

[Tardus et parvus]{.underline} refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound
spectral waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus
waveform is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and
diminished with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak
(parvus). This phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of
stenosis. Tardus parvus in the CFA represents upstream (iliac) stenosis.
Tardus parvus in the brachial artery likely represents upstream
(subclavian or axillary) stenosis.[@hwang2017; @pellerito2019]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide5.png"))

```

**So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting stenosis?**

[Distal stenosis:]{.underline} Distal occlusive disease will result in a
high resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal
stenosis with absent diastolic flow)

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide6.png"))

```

**Are there any considerations we need to understand when assessing a
stented vessel with ultrasound?**

Stenting decreases vessel compliance and increases observed velocities.
There is no defined consensus, but [in-stent restenosis]{.underline} is
classified by some as follows:

-   \>50%

    -   SFA - Vr \>1.5 or PSV \>200 [@baril2009; @kawarada2013]

    -   ICA - ICA/CCA \>2.7 and PSV \>220.[@lal2008]

-   \>80%

    -   SFA - Vr \> 3.5 or PSV \>275 [@baril2009; @kawarada2013]

    -   ICA - ICA/CCA \> 4.15 and PSV \> 340.[@lal2008]

It should be noted that restenosis of stents vs vein grafts in the lower
extremity will have higher velocity for the same percentage of stenosis.
Tardus et parvus waveforms distal to a stent should raise concern that
stenosis is hemodynamically significant.[@baril2009; @kawarada2013]

**Ultrasound compared to other diagnostic modalities**

Duplex is often adequate to visualize any peripheral arterial bed, even
the aorta and iliacs.[@muelaméndez2018]

-   CT - limitations include ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast and
    is not appropriate in patients with CKD.

-   MRA - is performed with gadolinium-based contrast and is not
    appropriate in patients with ESRD.

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move through by organ-system
high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies. We'll start
with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular
ultrasonography.

## Extracranial

**What does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?**

Examine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries

**What are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?**

[Normal ECA vs ICA waveform:]{.underline} The external carotid artery
waveform reflects a high resistance vascular bed. This means minimal
diastolic flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform reflects a low resistance
vascular bed with antegrade diastolic flow.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide7.png"))

```

This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying the brain while the ECA is
supplying the face. Intuitively, the common carotid artery is a mixture
of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies - like the ICA with forward
flow throughout diastole, but less as compared to the ICA due to the
high-resistance influence of the ECA.

Another way of differentiating the external and internal carotid
arteries is the "temporal tap". Tapping on the superficial temporal
artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in
the diastolic component of the external carotid artery.[@pellerito2019;
@size2013]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide8.png"))

```

**Can you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?**

[Parameters for ICA stenosis]{.underline}: These are a few numbers that
are (unfortunately) essential to memorize for the VSITE and RPVI.

Although criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus
Criteria, define ICA stenosis \>= 70% as a peak systolic velocity \>=
230 cm/sec, EDV \> 100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio \> 4.0. Of note,
post-stenting criteria vary from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis
criteria are not clearly defined for the CCA or ECA.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide9.png"))

```

**When is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?**

[Parameters for when surgery indicated:]{.underline}

Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) \>60% stenosis
asymptomatic, NASCET \>50% stenosis symptomatic

For more see \@ref(cerebrovascular).

**Let's talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on
extracranial ultrasound:**

[Pathologies:]{.underline} Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap),
aneurysms (rare), occlusion (no flow, do not operate), carotid body
tumor (splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by ECA branches), FMD.

FMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear
on the exams?

[Fibromuscular dysplasia]{.underline} of the internal carotid arteries
affects women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a "chain of
lakes" appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms.
Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is
typically found on Doppler interrogation.[@olin2012]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide10.png"))

```

[Aortic stenosis:]{.underline} Tardus parvus waveforms in both common
carotid arteries can be a sign of more proximal disease of the aortic
valve or global myocardial dysfunction.

**How to treat?**

Aspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if symptomatic.

**Are there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on
extracranial exam?**

[Subclavian steal:]{.underline} Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal
subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery
flow. This causes "stealing" of blood from the posterior cerebral
circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency.

**How does this look on duplex?**

Normal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA: antegrade low
resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout the cardiac
cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see mid-systolic
velocity deceleration ('bunny ears"), with mild stenosis bidirectional
flow can signify "pre-steal" phenomena, and with severe steal, there is
a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery towards the arm
rather than towards the brain.[@kalaria2005; @mousa2017]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide11.png"))

```

[Innominate stenosis:]{.underline} A phenomenon that is related to this,
is innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with
vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral
antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric
insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The
right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral
artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern
waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common
denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the
innominate artery.

**What other extracranial arteries of the head and neck can be evaluated
separately?**

[Temporal arteritis]{.underline} - well visualized with high frequency
transducer (10 MHz or greater). Pathognomonic halo effect of
anechoic/hypoechoic edematous tissue surrounding the lumen due to
concentric inflammation.[@ball2010; @schmidt2014]

## Intracranial

So that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about
intracranial?

This is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a brief overview
of views and some of the more commonly tested pathologies related to
transcranial doppler (TCD).

[**Intracranial:**]{.underline}

-   Three primary views: temporal, foraminal (occipital), orbital views

    -   **Temporal view:** Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and ICA.
        The MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the
        ACA flow direction is away.

    -   **Occipital view:** Basilar and vertebral arteries (both away).

    -   **Orbital view:** Ophthalmic and ICA

    -   Arteries differentiated by depth. MCA 3-6 cm, everything else
        deeper.

**What are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified on
TCD?**

Indications often tested:

-   [MCA spasm (severe PSV\>200)]{.underline}: Can be seen in sickle
    cell disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between
    mean velocities of \>200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children with
    sickle cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be
    reduced from \>10% to \<1% per year.
    [@bulasTranscranialDopplerTCD2000]

    -   Lindegrad ratio is the MCA velocity divided by the distal ICA
        velocity and can also be used to assess MCA spasm.

        -   Ratio of 3-6 is indicative of mild-mod vasospasm.

        -   \>6 is severe vasospasm.

        -   \<3 is a sign of hyperemia.[@kirsch2013]

-   [Cerebral ischemia during CEA:]{.underline} Comparing transcranial
    Doppler sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure
    measurement, and somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia
    was most accurately predicted by the percent change in transcranial
    Doppler detected middle cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a
    greater than 50% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using
    transcranial Doppler is 100% sensitive for detecting cerebral
    ischemia.[@moritzAccuracyCerebralMonitoring2007]

    -   TCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes of white
        vertical lines on spectral doppler) during CEA.

-   A shower of bubbles in both cerebral hemispheres upon injection with
    agitated saline is consistent with a R to L cardiac shunt and patent
    foramen ovale.[@zito2009]

-   Elevated contralateral ICA velocities can demonstrate compensatory
    flow and collateralization and can be a sign of persistent MCA
    occlusion.

-   Mechanical Compression of the vertebral arteries: TCD will show
    normal posterior circulation velocities at rest, disappearance of
    waveform on provocative maneuvers, and increase in velocity once
    back in a neutral position representing a reactive
    hyperemia.[@vilela2005]

-   Vasomotor activity can be evaluated as well with TCD. Hypercapnia or
    breath-holding should result in vasodilation and increased flow.
    Hypocapnia will result in decreased flow. No change in response to
    hyper or hypocapnia can show poor cerebral
    autoregulation.[@müller1995]

-   Reversal of flow in the ophthalmic artery can be a sign of
    ipsilateral ICA occlusion.[@guan2013]

-   Brain death determination - In patients with cerebral arrest (brain
    death) TCD will demonstrate a low amplitude, high-resistance
    waveform with to and fro flow with zero net flow.

## Upper Extremity

Having covered head and neck vasculature, let's move on to peripheral
vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice.
In this section we'll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity
vasculature.

**So first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the peripheral
vasculature?**

[Peripheral]{.underline}: Normal waveforms are indicative of high
resistance distal beds, so we would expect triphasic waveforms

**What are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?**

Normal pressure gradient between the right and left brachial pressures
is \<20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure is \>80% of the ipsilateral
brachial systolic pressure. Digital brachial index \<0.8 is abnormal and
\<0.5 is diagnostic of ischemia. Absolute digital pressure \<70mmHg is
abnormal and \<60mmHg is diagnostic for ischemia. A gradient between
digits of \>15 mmHg is considered abnormal. These criteria are used in
occlusive disease and steal syndrome.[@chloros2008; @sen2016]

**Let's talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies,
starting with arterial TOS.**

[Arterial TOS:]{.underline} Results from compression of the subclavian
artery at the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle.
Arterial TOS testing is done by placing a sensor, most often
photoplethysmography (PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the
resting waveforms and then recording while during maneuvers to evoke
arterial compression in the thoracic outlet.[@size2013]

**Can you tell us a little more about PPG testing?**

[Photoplethysmography (PPG)]{.underline} uses an infrared light to
illuminate superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a
photosensor, and amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the
volume of red blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial
PPG has a brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic
notch on the downslope during diastole.[@carter2001]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide12.png"))

```

Digital PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The
first changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch.
More advanced disease findings include a flattened systolic peak and a
prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is
a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the
positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with
the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted
that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some
degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.

**What are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?**

[Raynaud's:]{.underline} Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary
vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms
with immersion of the hand in cold water.

[Thromboangiitis obliterans:]{.underline} Is a segmental
non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder characterized by
microthrombosis that primarily involves the small- and medium-sized
arteries. Ultrasonography may demonstrate the classical "corkscrew"
collateral development at the level of occlusion. TA has a male
predominance and first-line treatment is smoking cessation.

### Hemodialysis Access

Before we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss
an entity frequently tested on the VSITE that constitutes for many
vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice: hemodialysis
access, and specifically fistulas.

[Fistulas]{.underline}: Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in
identifying suitable anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a
fistula for dialysis, and finally complications of fistulas.

**So first, assessment for fistula placement:**

The optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis of vein
mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure \>3 mm in diameter
(\>2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely to dilate under
anesthesia), and there should be no venous outflow stenosis or arterial
inflow stenosis.

Loss of phasic variation in the upper extremity veins may indicate
central stenosis and that extremity may not be appropriate for access
creation.[@kim2009; @lok2020] Duplex ultrasound arterial imaging can be
performed at the same time as vein mapping and can provide important
predictors of fistula maturation, such as arterial diameter and flow.
The minimal arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.

**How can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for hemodialysis
access?**

Rule of 6's: At six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula
should be at least 6 mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate
should be at least 600mL/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6
cm to allow for a successful two-needle dialysis.

Brachial artery volume flow rate (VFR) is one of the best measurements
to identify poor fistula maturation. \>800 ml/min is ideal, but \>600 is
often sufficient.[@ko2015] To determine the volume flow (VF) the sample
volume (SV) should be opened wall to wall in a segment of fistula that
is straight with a constant diameter and include all velocities present
within the fistula. Angle correction should be less than 60
degrees.[@gerrickens2018; @ko2015]

**What do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?**

[Waveform:]{.underline} The arterial waveform should demonstrate very
low resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one
half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning
fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an
iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and
vein.[@teodorescu2012]

**Let's discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies
identified in association with fistulas:**

[Pseudoaneurysms:]{.underline} Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a
puncture fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding
soft tissue. As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on
imaging by a communicating neck between the arterial vessel and
pseudoaneurysmal sac with "to-and-fro" waveform at duplex.[@mahmoud2015]
While small pseudoaneurysms can be managed without intervention or
surgery, larger pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms associated with
infection or overlying skin changes or bleeding may require excision and
repair.[@bandyk2013]

[Steal syndrome:]{.underline} Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as
access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all
patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by
retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal
of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with
an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and
represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal
syndrome. Digital pressures \<60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and specific
for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1
access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any
intervention.

**How do we treat more severe steal?**

Flow rate measurements of the fistula can help determine the optimal
treatment (banding, revision using distal inflow, distal
revascularization with interval ligation, proximalization of arterial
inflow or ligation of the fistula). For more on steal, see
\@ref(sec-steal-syndrome)

**So steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we talk
a bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?**

[Central venous stenosis:]{.underline} Venous outflow stenosis is the
most common reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate
results in recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction
manifests as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present
with collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.

[Stenosis of fistula:]{.underline} Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can
also cause complications, but are less common than venous stenosis.
Stenosis on imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter
of 50% (which correlates to a 75% reduction in cross-sectional area) on
b-mode ultrasound, PSV\>400, Vr \>2.5, high-resistance waveform proximal
to the stenosis, and tardus parvus waveform distal to the
stenosis.[@bandyk2013]

## Lower Extremity

**Can you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities that
are used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities?**

[ABIs:]{.underline} Ankle-brachial index measurement requires
calculating the ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior
tibial artery or dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic
pressure. Regardless of whether you're doing the R or L ABI, use the
higher arm pressure for both ratios. Normal ABI \>0.9, severe disease
indicated by ABI\<0.5, and CLI by ABI\<0.3.

The ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients is frequently unreliable
due to incompressibility of the tibial vessels at the level of the cuff
secondary to calcification. Consequently, toe pressures are mandatory in
all patients with diabetes mellitus. Normal TBI\>0.7.

Of note, monophasic waveforms in the brachial artery likely represent
proximal occlusive disease in the upper extremity and therefore make the
ABI non-diagnostic because the upper extremity blood pressure is not
likely not representative of central blood pressure.[@chen2014]

[TcPO2:]{.underline} When there is significant tissue loss, preventing
TBI measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry
(TcPO2).[@mills2014] Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of
measuring the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor
on the skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which
wound healing is impaired and ischemia develops.

**Are there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity
perfusion?**

[PVRs:]{.underline} Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have a
rapid upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope. This
typically uses 4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30% greater than
brachial pressure, hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal.
However, ABI/PVRs may not demonstrate significantly abnormal
values/waveforms in individuals with single level disease.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide13.png"))

```

[Exercise Test:]{.underline} During exercise testing, patients are
placed on a treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The
patient is then asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort
requires test cessation. The point when the patient reports pain starts
is the initial claudication distance and the point where the patient
stops is defined as the absolute claudication distance. Diagnostic
criteria for a positive test include a drop-in ankle pressure of greater
than 20 mmHg from baseline, drop in ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline,
or inability of ankle pressures to return to baseline after 3
minutes.[@strandness1964]

**So just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated with poor
wound healing?**

[Parameters associated with poor wound healing:]{.underline} Considering
these various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor
likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure \<50 mmHg, ABI \< 0.40,
TcPO2 \<20 mmHg, or a toe pressure \<20 mmHg are considered predictive
of non-healing.

**What is the utility of duplex in diagnosing lower extremity occlusive
disease?**

Duplex ultrasound is utilized to further delineate the anatomy, level
and severity of occlusive disease. Increased PSV can identify the site
of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Diminished waveforms often
suggest more proximal disease.

Of note, diffuse narrowing of the SFA can result in tardus et parvus
waveforms in the popliteal, without necessarily demonstrating any areas
of high velocity.[@aburahma2022; @pellerito2019]

While duplex ultrasound most easily visualizes infrainguinal arterial
disease, it can also be used to evaluate for iliac artery stenosis.
Patients with an iliac Vr\>2.5 or monophasic/biphasic waveforms in the
CFA, suggest that further imaging of the iliac system may be
required.[@heinen2018]

**Ultrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you talk
about graft surveillance parameters?**

Suggested bypass vein graft surveillance with ABI, clinical exam and
duplex should begin immediately after surgery and then continues at 3,
6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter.[@conte2006;
@zierler2018] A velocity ratio (Vr) is often utilized in graft
surveillance and is defined as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the
site of a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal vessel segment
proximal to the stenosis.

-   The highest risk for graft thrombosis, and highest cause for
    concern, is suggested by PSV \>300 cm/s, Vr \>3.5, a mid-graft flow
    velocity \<45 cm/s or a drop in ABI \>0.15.
    [@bandykHemodynamicsVeinGraft1988; @zierler2018]

-   Increased risk grafts have a PSV 180-300 cm/s and a Vr 2.0-3.5.

-   Spectral pulse wave doppler is more sensitive than color doppler to
    identify low flow states or thrombosed grafts.[@hedrick2005]

-   Criteria for prosthetic grafts is higher than vein bypass.
    [@zierler2018]

Intervention for recurrent vein bypass graft stenosis early after
angioplasty may be best treated with an open revision and patch
plasty.[@jongsma2016]

Presenting with new swelling, pain and fluid around a prosthetic graft
on duplex ultrasound may be a sign of underlying graft infection. PET
and WBC scans may be positive up to 4 months after implantation, so do
not provide much utility in the early post-operative period.[@puges2019]

### Pathologies

**Let's talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower
extremities:**

#### Pseudoaneurysms (particularly femoral) {#psa}

Gray-scale ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure
adjacent to an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a
"yin-yang sign" within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound
sign is identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery
with a "to-and-fro" spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck. This
represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and diastole.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide14.png"))

```

Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms develop in around 3% of femoral anastomoses
and can be associated with arterial wall weakness, endarterectomy,
mismatch between artery/graft, dilation/deterioration of graft material,
increased/uneven tension of the anastomosis, or underlying
infection.[@pellerito2019]

#### Dissections

Characteristic ultrasound findings on color Doppler include a parallel
blood-flow channel that separates the true and false lumen, with
diminished blood flow distally.[@ge2015; @kobayashi2018] Traumatic
intimal flaps after knee dislocation can have a normal ABI and be
asymptomatic, but they should be followed as they can
progress.[@gaitini2008] Of note, if the false lumen is filled by a
thrombus, it may not distinguishable from an intramural hematoma or

#### Buerger's Disease {#buerger}

Also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, this is a rare disease, but
with characteristic findings on ultrasound of serpiginous/corkscrew
collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal arteries, and normal
proximal arteries.[@busch2011; @fujii2011]

For more see \@ref(buergers-disease)

**There are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested
relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?**

#### **Cystic Adventitial Disease** {#cad}

This is a rare (but often tested) pathology. Adventitial cystic disease
is a non-atherosclerotic etiology of claudication, most often affecting
the popliteal artery in the lower extremity and leading to stenosis or
occlusion. Duplex imaging of the popliteal artery will demonstrate an
anechoic or hypoechoic *intraluminal* region with a smooth contour and
stenosis documented by velocity increase on spectral doppler.
Angiography will often show a classic "scimitar" sign - a smooth
well-defined crescent-shaped defect.[@shaw2007; @winn2015]

```

For more on adventitial cystic disease, see
\@ref(cystic-adventitial-disease). This is not to be confused with:

#### Bakers Cyst

A benign, cystic structure found in the popliteal fossa and arising from
the joint capsule. Flexion of the knee may result in compression of the
popliteal artery by the cyst. On b-mode ultrasound, a well-defined,
anechoic  cystic structure with a 'neck' extending into the joint space
between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the
gastrocnemius will be identified.

```

[Popliteal entrapment syndrome:]{.underline} decrease in ABI or loss of
distal pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the
foot caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius.

## Abdominal

Lowest frequency transducers (2-4MHz) are used for imaging abdominal
vessels.

### Aorta

**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA):** Ultrasound screening of a AAA is
non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective.[@chaikof2018]

-   Sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% for AAA
    diagnosis.[@wilmink2002]

-   Aneurysm is measured in transverse view, anterior to posterior
    diameter, outer wall to outer wall.[@iac2021] Size criteria for AAA
    repair is 5.5 cm men, 5.0-5.5 cm in women.

-   Can be limited by bowel gas or obesity - so recommend fasting.

-   For more details, see\@ref(abdominal-aneurysms).

**Can ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?**

Surveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT imaging at 1 year
exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak (or stable type II
endoleak). Contrast enhanced duplex, in particular, has a high
sensitivity and specificity to detect endoleaks.[@abraha2017;
@kapetanios2019; @chaer2009]

Type II endoleak classification is subdivided on surveillance duplex.
Type IIa has a single inflow vessel and a "to-and-fro" appearance,
whereas Type IIb has multiple vessels and maintains a monophasic flow.
Type IIa endoleaks with velocities greater than 100cm/sec are not likely
to spontaneously resolve and may be resistant to therapy.[@arko2003;
@vanmarrewijk2004]

Type II endoleaks with stable sac size can continue surveillance with
color duplex.[@chaikof2018; @karthikesalingam2012; @chaer2009] Any
findings concerning for growth, endoleak or flow in the sac should have
confirmatory CTA performed.[@maleux2017]

Surveillance duplex does not reliably detect graft migration given
challenge of renal arteries visualization in a long axis view of the
aorta.[@busch2009]

Velocities within stents are elevated from baseline due to stent
rigidity, but a limb velocity \>300cm/s with a Vr \>3.5 is associated
with a high risk of limb occlusion from stenosis or kinking and should
undergo further investigation or intervention.[@chaikof2018; @blom2012]

**What other pathologies can be identified on ultrasound evaluation of
the abdomen?**

[CIA aneurysms:]{.underline} SVS defines CIA aneurysms as any permanent,
localized dilatation of the iliac artery \>1.5 cm in diameter (diameter
1.5x the normal diameter)

[Para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms:]{.underline} As previously discussed
(reported in up to 0.5% to 10% of cases)

[Penetrating aortic ulcers:]{.underline} Describes an ulcerating
atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into
the media. Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound

[Dissections:]{.underline} (as already discussed) a dissection flap is
usually identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and
false lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.

### Mesenteric Vasculature

**So far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But this
is an area frequently encountered on exams. Let's start with mesenteric
vessel stenosis.**

**Celiac and SMA stenosis:** May present as chronic mesenteric ischemia.
PSV \>275 cm/s in the SMA or \>200 cm/s in the celiac artery indicates
\>=70% stenosis. Normal SMA Doppler waveforms in the fasting patient
show high resistance waveform, PSV \<275 cm/s and no spectral
broadening. In the postprandial state, the waveform becomes low
resistance, with a slightly increased PSV and little to no spectral
broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may be differentiated by the
presence of spectral broadening and elevated PSV (\>275cm/s) and EDV
(\>55cm/s).[@aburahma2012; @oderich2019] Distal to the stenosis, one
would expect a tardus parvus waveform. EDV \>45 in SMA or \>55 in celiac
are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher diastolic flow in celiac
trunk given low resistance vascular bed of liver and spleen).

Reversal of flow in the hepatic artery and mildly elevated SMA
velocities may indirectly signify severe stenosis or occlusion of the
celiac artery.

Note that aberrant anatomy with the hepatic artery arising from the SMA,
will result in the proximal SMA demonstrating a low resistance waveform,
even in the fasted state.[@pellerito2019]

Mesenteric duplex is still valid even if the patient has not fasted. The
images may be technically more difficult to acquire due to bowel gas,
however if velocities can be obtained, you are likely to see elevated
PSV and low resistance waveform in the SMA. The EDV will also be
elevated and should be interpreted with caution.

**IMA Stenosis:** PSV \>200 cm/s or aortic ratio \>2.5 has a high
sensitivity for hemodynamically significant stenosis. However, this is
rarely clinically significant and does not require treatment.

**What other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on vascular
ultrasound?**

[Dissections:]{.underline} Rare without concomitant aortic dissection,
describe only in case reports.[@gouëffic2002; @oglesby2006]

[Aneurysms:]{.underline} Rare. Repair \>2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA
aneurysms and \>3 cm splenic and renal.

[Median arcuate ligament syndrome:]{.underline} MALS can cause
significantly elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery.
Testing is for reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed
lesion from atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the
upright position the MAL is elevated and celiac velocities should
normalize if stenosis is secondary to MALS.[@tembey2015]

[Hepatic artery thrombosis:]{.underline} Mesenteric duplex is often
performed in liver transplant patients. Hepatic artery thrombosis most
often occurs within the first 30 days after liver transplantation, with
an incidence of 1.5-9% and a mortality rate of 75%.[@garcía-criado2009;
@sanyal2012]

### Portal Vein

**So I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous
circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric
vascular exam, let's discuss portal venous ultrasonography.**

Normal portal venous flow is hepatopetal (toward the liver), whereas
abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal (away from the liver). (The
root "fugua" means to flee, or flight). Flow should be in the same
direction as the hepatic artery.

Other abnormalities that may be visualized are portal vein thrombosis -
often associated with portal venous hypertension in patients with
chronic cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute portal
vein thrombosis on ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of the portal vein
with hypoechoic intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is
characterized by a contracted vein with heterogeneous/hyperechoic echoes
and may be associated with collateral formation.[@chawla2015;
@nouvini2013]

Mesenteric duplex can also assess for functioning of TIPS (transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). A sign of a failing TIPS is portal
vein peak systolic velocity less than 30cm/s.

### Renal arteries

**Awesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation, let's
complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a
discussion of the renal vasculature.**

[Renal Pathologies:]{.underline} ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery
(FMD)

[Atherosclerotic stenosis:]{.underline} PSV \> 285 cm/s and Renal-aortic
ratio (RAR) \>3.5, suggest \>60% stenosis.[@schäberle2016] However
aortic PSV needs to be within normal range (40-100) to be appropriately
interpreted.

The renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as the RA (PSV-EDV)/PSV.
The RRI (\>0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic parenchymal renal disease.
RRI has been used for assessment of transplant renal allograft
rejection, decision making for treatment of renal artery stenosis and to
evaluate progression of CKD. Diabetic nephropathy will demonstrate
elevated RRI, signifying parenchymal disease.[@viazzi2014] One study
showed it was associated with poor renal and overall outcome in
critically ill patients.[@ledorze2012]

[FMD:]{.underline} Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) will demonstrate
tortuous renal arteries with turbulent flow and increased PSV of the
mid-distal portions. Beading may be difficult to see on ultrasound
(compared to the extracranial carotid). Atherosclerosis disease is
primarily ostial in nature.

[In-stent restenosis]{.underline}: Higher cut off values are required to
determine in stent restenosis.[@chi2009; @schäberle2016]

[Renal artery aneurysms:]{.underline} Can see a yin-yang sign.
[@gutta2008; @ham2014]

## Venous {#sec-venous}

**Venous Exam:** Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous reflux
duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral doppler
imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative maneuvers
are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial deep
veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins) are evaluated
with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency. Diameters are also
included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode images are used for
vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to ensure that the
vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as opposed to simply
slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal views. Reflux exam
should be performed with a patient standing, with assessment performed
on the non weight-bearing leg.

**We've talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what do
normal venous waveforms look like?**

[Normal venous waveforms:]{.underline} Normal flow patterns of iliac and
femoral veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal
compression. In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms
normally demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.

**What does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation**?

**Pulsatility:** Refers to changes in the venous waveform in accordance
with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper extremity
veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide18.png"))

```

This is an abnormal finding in the lower extremity veins, and may be a
sign of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or tricuspid
regurgitation.[@kakish1996; @mcclure2000]

**Phasicity:** (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in the
waveform with respiration. This results from increasing and decreasing
intrathoracic pressures secondary to respiration. Phasicity is an
indicator of a patency proximal to the point of measurement. So if we
see lack of phasicity (continuous flow) in the left femoral vein but
normal phasicity in the right, we would be concerned for left iliac vein
occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence of phasicity (continuous flow)
in the bilateral femoral veins, we would be concerned for IVC
obstruction or stenosis.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide19.png"))

```

**Augmentation:** Distal compression that augments forward flow. For
example, if we are measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze the
calf and we see augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of
occlusion in the venous system from the knee to the probe.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide20.png"))

```

**What are venous pathologies that are commonly tested/encountered?**

### Reflux

Venous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best assessed with duplex
scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the common femoral vein and
the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with a Valsalva maneuver
(which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but release of a pneumatic
cuff compression is a more reproducible method. Reflux is identified as
reverse flow - that is, away from the heart - following valsalva or
release of the compression cuff.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide21.png"))

```

Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally
reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 0.5
seconds for the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial, and
deep femoral veins.[@gloviczki2011; @lurie2012; @labropoulos2003]

[Perforator veins:]{.underline} Perforator veins connect the deep and
superficial venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the
muscle. Size \>3.5 mm and reflux \>350 ms (deep to superficial) is
associated with perforator reflux.[@min2003; @odonnell2014; @sandri1999]
Pathological perforators are found in association with a healed or
non-healed ulcer.

**What are some other examples of reflux?**

[Ovarian vein reflux:]{.underline} The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic
congestion syndrome is performed in a fasting patient in steep reverse
Trendelenburg and standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux
is identified during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated
criteria for the duration of reflux, rather, an ovarian vein diameter
\>6 mm is considered significant.

### May Thurner Syndrome

May Thurner syndrome is also known as iliac vein compression syndrome,
refers to a chronic compression of the left [common iliac
vein](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-vein?lang=us) by the
overlying right [common iliac
artery](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-artery?lang=us) (CIA),
with or without [deep venous
thrombosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deep-vein-thrombosis?lang=us).
Notably, patients present with unilateral (left) lower extremity edema
and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers. Intravascular ultrasound
will demonstrate \>50% stenosis of the iliac vein from compression.

Iliac obstruction, whether a result so May Thurner or not, would
demonstrate continuous flow with a loss of phasicity and reduced
augmentation with distal compression or valsalva. Additional indirect
ultrasound findings include collaterals and reversal of flow. Direct
ultrasound findings include intraluminal changes.[@metzger2016]

### Nutcracker Syndrome

Nutrcracker syndrome is most often diagnosed based on IVUS, venogram or
renal vein pressures, but there are also diagnostic criteria for duplex
ultrasonography. The left renal vein velocity ratio is the velocity at
the aortomesenteric angle divided by the velocity near the left renal
hilum. A ratio greater than 5 has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity
of 94% for Nutcracker syndrome.[@kim1996; @kim2019]

### **Thrombosis**

[Thrombosis:]{.underline} Characteristics of acute thrombus are an
echolucent and incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with
significant distension.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide22.png"))

```

Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter
greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall
thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and collaterals
are found in chronic thrombosis.

Components of a lower extremity DVT study include doppler waveforms in
response to provocative maneuvers in the common femoral, femoral and
popliteal veins. When performing a DVT scan, the technician should
evaluate the contralateral femoral vein flow to compare flow
patterns.[@needleman2018; @societyforvascularultrasound2019] Transverse
views are used for compression and compressibility testing every 3-5cm
is the most reliable evaluation for thrombus.[@malgor2013]

**Let's discuss some examples of venous thrombosis**

**Venous TOS:** Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis or severe
stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to chronic
extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the subclavian
vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in chronic injury
to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated, non-compressible vein
consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or lack of
pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally located.
Duplex ultrasound is 81-100% sensitive for diagnosing upper extremity
DVT.@mustafa2002

**EHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis:** S/p endovenous thermal
ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1 is
thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If \< 50% of the CFV
lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is extension into
the CFV occupying \>50% of the lumen and grade 4 is occlusion of the
CFV.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide23.png"))

```

EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with anticoagulation to reduce
risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the catheter should be
positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction.

**Superficial vein thrombosis:** when scanning for superficial vein
thrombosis, pornographers should scan superficial and deep veins of the
ipsilateral leg and the contralateral central veins with doppler wave
form, because the incidence of concomitant thrombosis is not
insignificant.[@decousus2010; @iac2021;
@societyforvascularultrasound2019] This is discussed more in our venous
chapter: \@ref(superficial-vein-thrombosis)

### Vein Mapping

One additional venous study often performed in the lower extremity is
mapping of the GSV for planning lower extremity bypasses. Mapping should
identify the general course of the GSV and any major tributaries,
particularly if the anterior or posterior accessory veins are of a size
that might be a reasonable additional conduit.[@cohn2006] Sonographers
should also make note of any significant areas of tortuosity or aneurysm
that might compromise the quality of the bypass conduit. Size
measurements are usually made along the GSV.

In general the ideal size for conduit is 3-4mm throughout it's length,
with a size of greater than 2mm at the ankle.[@leopold1989] These size
assessments are usually the same regardless of whether the vein will be
fully harvested and reversed or utilized in situ. The small saphenous
vein can be utilized for a conduit if the GSV is not adequate and the
diameter is 3-4mm.[@chang1992; @nierlich2019]

## Artifacts

Finally, let's wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging
artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular
ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order
to prevent incorrect interpretation.

**Acoustic shadowing:** Shadowing on an ultrasound image is
characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb,
reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide24.png"))

```

Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly
reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a "dark
area" beneath the plaque. Subcutaneous air can result in shadowing and
loss of imaging information, which can be seen in some soft tissue
necrotising infections.[@thom2017]

**Acoustic enhancement** is essentially the inverse situation, and
appears as a "bright area" deep to structures that transmit ultrasound
waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep to fluid-filled
structures such as cysts.

**Mirroring**: A mirror-image artifact is caused by reverberation of
ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side of a strong
reflector as also being present on the other side of the reflector.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide25.png"))

```

This is often seen around the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the
strong reflection of ultrasound from the air-filled lung. These
artifacts can occur in both B-mode imaging where you see the mirrored
image and Doppler, in which you see the mirrored waveform. The clavicle
is also a strong spectral reflector, and thus can result in a mirror
effect and a duplicate subclavian artery.[@rubin2010]

**Refraction:** A refraction artifact is the result of ultrasound waves
passing through tissues with different propagation velocities (such as
air and water) and causes a structure to be improperly positioned
laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon that results in a straw
appearing bent when in a glass of water.

**Speed artifact:** Depth determination by an ultrasound machine is
based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound in
soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a medium
at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate image
depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly through
the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then the
image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical
application, this is what causes a "bayonet" sign, or apparent bending
of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.

**Inappropriate color gain:** Overly gained images will show "speckling"
in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft tissue).
Increasing the gain, increases both the signal and the
noise.[@kremkau2021] The noise added to the spectral waveform can result
in PSV overestimation.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide26.png"))

```

Under-gaining will result in reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.

**Inappropriate angle correction:** Make sure the angle correction
cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls, otherwise
the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect. Increasing the
doppler angle will increase the velocity measurement (if no change to
angle correction is made).

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide27.png"))

```

Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot
on exams:

**Aliasing:** Unlike [continuous wave
Doppler](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/continuous-wave-doppler?lang=us),
pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by rapid pulses of
ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency). The
[Nyquist limit](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us)
defines the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to the
PRF/2. So what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler, if
the velocity of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity will
be cut off, and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab2/Slide28.png"))

```

This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities, and may be
remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color flow
doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of a
black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity
(such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an
increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the
direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should
assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along
vessel walls.

## Accreditation and Credentialing

**Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) Accreditation** -
voluntary, not linked to reimbursement but may be required by some
payers. Medical director must have a certain training/experience,
including RPVI as one way; technical directors must have credentials
through ARDMS, CCI or ACR with recredentialing every three
years.[@iac2021]

-   Physician accreditation with RPVI requires recertification every 3
    years with 30 hours of CME specifically in the area of vascular
    ultrasound.

Regulations for a completed vascular exam report[@iac2021]

-   Patient identifier

-   Date of exam

-   Sign/symptom as indication - medical necessity should not just
    include "rule out"

-   Reasons for any limitations to the examination

-   Comparisons to any previous related studies

-   Reported by medical staff within 2 working days and final report
    verified within 4 working days.

Troubleshooting examinations

-   Any concerning acute findings, such as mobile intra-arterial
    material concerning for embolism, should be reported to the
    supervising/reading physician immediately before completing the
    examination.[@societyofdiagnosticmedicalsonography2015]

-   Some modifications to tests can be made if the patient is unable to
    tolerate, such as standing or tolerating a valsalva
    maneuver.[@societyofdiagnosticmedicalsonography2015]
