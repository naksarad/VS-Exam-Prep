# About

This content was developed by the [Audible Bleeding Team](https://www.audiblebleeding.com/about-1/) to accompany our board review podcast series.
Each chapter covers a key domain of vascular surgery, essential for board review preparation, and is associated with an Audible Bleeding episode which you can access through the link embeded into the text. 

## Usage 

This e-book is not intended to be a comprehensive board review revision guide, but instead serves as an easily accessible resource, paired with our podcast content to help streamline board preparation.
