## Chronic Venous Insufficiency

### Terminology and Presentation

**What is chronic venous insufficiency and how common is it?**

I thought the first question was going to be nice, easy
and uncontroversial, but you've started with CVI. What you've highlighted is
one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So
if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up
with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of
different ways, by lots of different people.

One of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people
within the venous space and everywhere else. A really important
documents to guide people is the VEIN-TERM consensus document
published in 2009.[@eklof2009] The lead author was Dr. Bo Eklof and this
was a document where a group of venous experts around the world
got together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all
these different terms mean.

And one of the terms that was described was chronic venous insufficiency.
The official definition is it is a venous disease between C3 and C6
on the CEAP classification. We'll talk about that a bit later, I'm sure.
But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the entire
spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the way up
to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would urge
anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein term
documents.[@ekl√∂f2004; @eklof2009]

And silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous
vein--I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and
the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser
saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I'd urge
anyone to look at that document.

**How common is chronic venous insufficiency?**

Chronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit
nicer, people wearing shorts, you're spotting, venous disease all over
the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a
quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So a very
common problem, with lots of people that need treatment.

The Edinburgh Vein Study found that half of the general populatino with
chronic venous disease deteriorated over the 13 year study. Factors
associated with disease progression included family/personal history of
DVT. Of note, female gender, obesity, number of pregnancies, and smoking
status were not associated with progression.[@lee2015]

**Now we would like to discuss the classification and scoring systems,
you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?**

So CEAP\--clinical, etiological (with an E because it's American),
anatomical, pathophysiological--classification system was introduced, I
think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum. And it's a classification system.

So if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous
problem, it's a system to allow you to describe that patient's current
status in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you
any information about prognostication and it isn't useful for measuring
responses to treatment.

So it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most
commonly used part is the clinical bit, which is C1 to C6. CEAP was just recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which
again, I would urge trainees to have a look at, Dr. Fedor Lurie was the
lead author, and this was a useful revision of CEAP.[@lurie2020]

Now in response to the limitations of CEAP, the Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item
scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now
this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to
CEAP.[@vasquez2010]

There are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life
tools or VDS, but I would say that those two (CEAP and VCSS) are the most relevant and
important ones to know about. Many of the QOL tools are too
cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of a easy
to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient
reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I've reviewed where
people have reported CEAP scores as one of the outcome measures in
response to treatments. That is not what it's designed for, for example,
you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed
ulcer. So again, that's the important distinction.

### Evaluation

**When we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous insufficiency,
which type of imaging modalities should we use to investigate the
function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?**

If a patient comes to clinic, we can't underestimate the importance of
the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you are really
looking for the impact of their venous
disease on their quality of life and the impact of the venous disease
has on their normal function.

But also you're looking for complications of venous disease. This is a
clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really
want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease.
And that's the goal of any investigation.

Venous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that
pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is
essentially gives you information about the venous flow, antegrade or retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep
veins.

It'll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will
help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other
information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral
vein, for example, if there's good phasicity of flow or if there's any
scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow
obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold
standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see \@ref(venous).

Now, once you've done the duplex imaging, if there's clinical suspicion,
then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV,
MRV, venography, IVUS.
But clinical assessments and duplex assessment are the bedrock of every
assessment of every venous patient. So that's the foundation.

### Management

**Moving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk about
treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don't think we can
really get away from talking about the two major studies, the
ESCHAR**[@gohel2007] **and the EVRA**[@gohel2018] **studies, which I
know you've been involved with. Can you review what these studies showed
and their importance in the care of our patients.**

Before I go into the trials, I'm just going to go back a step and just
talk about the general mindset that's important for these patients. So
what we're treating with these patients is not superficial venous
reflux. What we're treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we're
treating a pathophysiological entity of which the superficial
reflux is one correctable factor. And the reason that's important is
that there may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow obstruction, 
which may be addressed. Decision making also takes into account patient presentation. For
example a patient with asymptomatic varicose veins, even with proximal
obstruction and superficial reflux, should still only be treated with
compression.[@vandenboezem2011; @wittens2015]

But there are also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as poor
mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle is
stiff, you can't use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don't
have that mechanism for reducing the  venous pressure in your legs. So the
success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population, has
to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.

Having said that, the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most
patients with venous ulceration have superficial reflux. So what is
the role of treating the superficial reflux? That's the simple question
that was asked by these trials.

The ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, and included 500 patients with
healed and open leg ulcers. They were either randomized to compression or
compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery (stripping or
ligation). And that trial was very clear. It showed that with venous
stripping there wasn't a benefit for healing, but there was a
significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer
recurrence.[@gohel2007]

So one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn't have the
same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We
don't really do stripping anymore, it's all endovenous. So EVRA really
aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450
patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered
within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again
is common sense, if you deal with the underlying problem (usually superficial reflux), the venous
ulceration healed significantly quicker.[@gohel2018]

So putting them together, there is a clear, unequivocal argument for treating the
superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as possible.

#### Endovenous

**Can you broadly outline the different treatment options that can be
offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?**

I have counted about 42 different ways of destroying a saphenous vein.
There are lots of different treatment options. Do
something that you're trained in and proficient with and something
that's appropriate. Thermal ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots
of other international guideline documents has been combined, whether
it's radiofrequency or laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when
studied in randomized trials, has lower technical success rates and
lower vein closure rates, the clinical success rates in terms of healing
are just as good. This reduced effectiveness in closing
the vein, doesn't really seem to translate into a significant drop in
clinical effectiveness after foam sclerotherapy.

So I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use,
it's doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it.
However, there are a few relative contraindications to GSV
ablation.[@atasoy2015; @gloviczki2011; @kabnick2019] These include:

-   GSV \>12mm width raises concern for incomplete obliteration

-   Superficial GSV unlikely to be pushed down with tumescence - could
    cause staining or thermal injury to the skin

-   GSV tortuosity may limit the ability to pass a catheter and
    sufficiently ablate the vein

-   Acute superficial vein thrombosis.

**When we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention, what
risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be aware
of?**

You can spend an hour doing this, if you're being very diligent. But
what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous
thromboembolism, as is the risk of any intervention. And I think that's
worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a
risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions. Extension
of proximal thrombus into the deep system is termed endothermal
heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) and is evaluated and treated more
aggressively in the United States.[@sadek2013; @kabnick2021] EHIT is
defined as:

| EHIT Grade | Description                                            | Treatment                            |
|:-----------:|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
|     1      | Extension to SFJ                                       | None                                 |
|     2      | Extension into deep system \<50% of lumen diameter     | Close observation vs anticoagulation |
|     3      | Extension into the deep system \>50% of lumen diameter | Anticoagulation                      |
|     4      | Occlusion of the femoral or popliteal vein             | Anticoagulation                      |

There's always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I
often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels.
And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of
nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are
worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence.

Foam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It's a detergent
that's injected into the vein that destroys the endothelium. And there are
some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some
neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the
manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and
found very few events-around one in 4-5,000.

There are a number of complications related to sclerotherapy that should
be understood. Hyperpigmentation is probably the most common
complication (11-80%), but only a small percentage persist up to a year
(1-2%). Incision and drainage of the thrombus 2-4 weeks after treatment
may reduce hyperpigmentation. New appearance of fine red telangiectasias
(AKA telangiectatic matting) is related to underlying vessel injury in
5-57% of patients and can persist up to 1 year (1%). Cutaneous necrosis
is rare (\<1%) and results from extravasation of sclerosing agent,
injection into dermal arteriole, reactive vasospasm or excessive
cutaneous pressure. DVT and cutaneous nerve injury are also
rare.[@bergan2006; @munavalli2007]

Some people say that if there is a history of migraine, then the risk of
these neurological events might be a little bit higher. So, a little bit
of caution, although in practice, I've treated many people with
migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or five,
people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of those
people, so the risks are very low but it's just important to have that
discussion beforehand.

**Are there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of these
risks?**

So I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically
discussing. It's a very rare event after superficial venous
interventions, but it's potentially catastrophic, with sometimes 
national press coverage for bad outcomes.  What we've got to
realize is that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost
certainly some people that have a higher risk. And so what we've got
to get slightly smarter about is identifying the people that have a
higher risk of VTE and maybe giving them prolonged course of
thromboprophylaxis, as well as appropriate counseling and mitigation as
well.

So it's about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk
assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to
superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the
Caprini tools don't really take into account some of the really
important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial
venous interventions.

There's nothing validated, there's nothing widely available, but we have
a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous
interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as
previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant
chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease), these
patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized.
There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity,
comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with
a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered
extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin. 

In addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally
things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn't usually
stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen
containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It's an easily
reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients,
I would normally recommend that we stop the pill or HRT a full month before and after the procedure.

**You mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those
patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that
you use for this?**

The venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly
this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these
patients. However, if there's an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then
actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may
be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk
patients.

However, if they are really that high risk, you've really got to
question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing
the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk
period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful
not to stop prophylaxis too soon.

**Moving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is the
role for treating and competent perforator veins in these patients?**

In general, the more advanced the venous disease, the
more likely it is that the disease is recurrent, the more likely
there is to be deep venous disease or posts thrombotic disease, and the
more likely you are to finding incompetent perforators. If you imagine
these patients with venous ulcer, it is very common to find perforators,
and if you take a sort of super aggressive role saying you've got to
obliterate every single bit of reflux you can find, then you'd be doing
a couple of perforators in every single patient, and that is the
approach of a number of centers around the world.

The pragmatic reality is, number one, if you ablate the superficial
reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually become
competent because we've got rid of the outflow or you've changed the
dynamics in some other way, and they've become competent. Number two,
even if they've stayed incompetent, the clinical benefit is still there
and is usually still pretty durable. The clinical criteria most often
used to as an indication for treatment is \>350ms of deep to superficial
reflux, diameter greater than 3.5mm (associated with reflux in 90% of
patients)[@sandri1999] and near a healed or active ulcer.[@odonnell2014;
@min2003; @rueda2013]

Now, of course, there may be some people that develop recurrent problems
and then there can be a more targeted approach to the perforator. The
ESCHAR and EVRA studies did not target perforators at all and the
outcomes in the EVRA study was the best healing rate of any published
prospective leg ulcer study. So, putting all that together, it's
difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of perforators first
up. Having said that for some people with recurrent disease, it's not
uncommon to have a big mid thigh **Huntarian perforator or Cocker's**
perforator lower down on the medial calf. So, I do treat perforators,
but almost always it's in recurrent disease with recurrence or
deteriorating symptoms.

#### Open Surgery

**So we've discussed quite a bit about endovenous intervention. Is there
a role for open surgery in some patients?**

Open surgery remains the most commonly used superficial venous
intervention around the world, and there are still lots of centers in
the UK that primarily offer open surgery. Being balanced, it's a very
effective treatment if you do it well and if you use modern approaches, such as
tumescent anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, then actually some of the
traditional issues with open surgery, which are often technical and
complication related, don't really apply.

Having said that, all the randomized trials have shown the same thing
while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the
recovery is much better after endovenous ablation. So it's difficult to
make the case for open surgery when you've got something that is so well
established and the complications just so low, and it's cheaper when you
look at their theater capacity, et cetera.

So, I think there has to be a move towards endovenous, but there
are lots of things stopping this. In Germany, for example, the
reimbursement is greatest for open surgery. So surprise, surprise, there
are still lots and lots of open varicose vein operations. For
trainees, it is important to recognise that if you want to change practice, the single biggest driver
for change is reimbursement. You can change whatever you like. So, I've treated maybe three patients with open surgery in the last
five years. One was a GP, who I had treated the other leg with open
surgery a few years earlier, and she said, "I want the same operation,
please." So I did struggle to argue with that. The other two were big
three, four, five centimeters saphenovarices in the groin. So specific
indications, but not really for most patients.

For deep venous reflux, surgical management follows a relatively complex
algorithm.[@odonnell2014] Valve prolapse due to vein wall dilation may
be treated with external banding. Isolated valve prolapse may be treated
with external valvuloplasty, and in severe cases an internal
valvuloplasty. When no adequate valve exists, then valve transplant from
a distant source, such as the axilla, may be necessary.[@kabbani2011]
These are not commonly performed procedures and should be referred to
centers with significant experience.

#### Medical Therapy

**So we've talked about endovenous and surgical treatment, but are there
any pharmacological therapies that can be used in patients with chronic
venous insufficiency?**

So we're pretty skeptical in the UK, when it comes to venoactive or
pharmacological treatments. If you go to Europe, they love them. They're over the counter in a lot of pharmacies.
The drug with probably the most evidence is something called Daflon,
micronized purified flavonoid fraction.

So flavonoids are naturally occurring, venoactive compounds. There are a
whole variety of effects, only some of which we understand. But a lot of
studies have shown improvements in edema and heaviness. Daflon is
marketed by a French company and it's got good evidence, but they do not
see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our inherent
skepticism over these sort of things, to make it worth their while to go
through the marketing and the regulatory processes. So it's not available.
But patients that have gone to France and picked it up over the counter
and have said it works well. So there may be a roll for some venoactive medications such as 
pentoxyphyllin ---there's some good evidence that
it accelerates healing of leg ulcers.

But I don't think we're very receptive in the UK in general, not in the
vascular surgery community to prescribe pharmacological or herbal type
remedies.

Wound management in patients with venous insufficiency however has many
medical adjuncts. Topic agents include excimer (cadexomer) iodine,
silver sulfadiazine, silver-containing dressings, growth factors or
cell-based therapy.

**What are the healthcare costs associated with the lower extremity
venous disease?**

The educated guesstimates in the UK, NHS, is around 2 billion pounds a
year. The UK NHS budget is about a 120 billion. So, up to about 2% of
the budget, and that's just C6 disease. We're not even going into all of
the other diseases, the associated cellulitis, but also not only the
healthcare costs, but the societal costs, the time off work, the other
things. And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis, VTE and
other associated diseases, it's a massive underestimate.

### Other Complications of Superficial Venous Disease

#### Superficial Vein Thrombosis

**You mentioned superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial
thrombophlebitis. What is it and how do you manage it?**

I'm very pleased you used both terms because I'm going to take the
opportunity to encourage robustly the use of **superficial vein
thrombosis** rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem with
thrombophlebitis is it is too closely associated with an infectious
etiology, which can lead to useless courses of antibiotics. Of course,
there's no infection, it's a thrombus in a superficial vein.
Traditionally, it's just been seen as just a bit of a nuisance and let's
not worry about it, treat with analgesia and anti-inflammatories, and
you'll be fine.

It can be a really sinister pathology and associated with VTE. If you
think of how many thousands, millions of people that have varicose
veins. They don't all get clots in their varicose veins. They've all got
stasis to a certain extent but they don't get clots. So it's more than
just the flow dynamics going on here. These people likely have an
thrombogenic innate tendency that leads to this. That's shown out in the
studies, some really good work in some French studies, such as the POST study. They identified
patients who were scanned with superficial vein thrombosis, and a
quarter of them on their first duplex scan had a DVT. A lot of these
DVTs were remote to the superficial vein thrombosis.[@decousus2010]
So they're not all extending into the deep vein---they were
remote---confirming this idea that actually a thrombogenic problem is
going on here. A patient with superficial vein thrombus and a previous
history of DVT could suggest a subsequent risk of VTE up to 20%.

So in the latest ESVS guidelines, there is quite a lot of content about
SVT treatment with algorithms. I would urge people to have a look at that,
and it's important to risk stratify people. Limited disease can be
followed with ultrasound at 1-2 weeks, but the closer you are to the
junction, the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a
bit of clot in a varicosity, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice
to reduce progression to VTE.[@kakkos2021; @dinisio2018; @scovell2018]

| NSAIDs and Warm Compresses |     Anticoagulation      |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|     Low risk Patients      |    High risk patients    |
|   Segment less than 5cm    | Segment greater than 5cm |
|      Remote from SFJ       |  Less than 5cm from SFJ  |

CALISTO is the largest RCT and used treatment with 2.5mg SC
Fondaparinux.[@calistostudygroup2010; @blondon2012] Rivaroxaban did
subsequently demonstrate non-inferiority.[@werth2016] So look at the
guidelines, it's very clear what we should be doing with these people,
evidence-based, Once the anticoagulation is done, they need to be
re-scanned and that residual incompetent, scarred thrombogenic,
saphenous vein needs to be ablated or excised, otherwise they'll recur.
So a real change in mindset and level of aggression.[@kakkos2021;
@dinisio2018; @scovell2018]

Pregnant patients are often high risk for lower extremity venous
complications and pose difficult clinical challenges. Extensive
superficial vein thrombus in pregnant patients should be treated with
LMWH and paused at delivery.[@kupelian2007; @litzendorf2011] If symptoms
persist 3-6mo after delivery, the further workup for pelvic congestive
syndrome may be required with a transvaginal ultrasound or cross
sectional imaging.[@labropoulos2017]

#### Bleeding

**What's your approach to managing patients with bleeding varicose
veins?**

Really important question. It is a vascular emergency. There are several
depressing reports of patients having died from bleeding from a
varicosity. These are often elderly patients who are frail, with limited mobility , and therefore can't bend down to press on the
bleeding varicosity down by the ankle ulcer. There's some very grim
photos in various case reports and it's really sad. There's two or three
photos that I've seen where an elderly patient has not wanted to wake
their partner and so has gone and laid down in the bath with this
bleeding vein that they couldn't control and basically exsanguinated.

So, it's a vascular emergency and these patients should be seen and
assessed and their superficial venous disease should be dealt with as
soon as possible. We have an emergency clinic running and anyone with
bleeding veins have the same urgency as the CLI patients and they were
treated there and then.

In terms of the treatment, there's two aspects: you want to decompress
the venous hypertension by ablating the saphenous reflux, but for the
specific bleeding area, I think there's a real case for some local foam
sclerotherapy. You want to block off that vulnerable bleeding vein to
ensure that this doesn't happen again. But again, if anyone receives a
referral, these are people to see straight away.

## Acute Thrombosis - Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)

**So let's move on to discuss deep venous thrombosis. You're recently
involved in the European society of vascular surgery, venous thrombosis
guidelines. In the most part, calf DVTs are managed by medical teams or
dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this section, we'll be
focusing mostly on proximal DVT.**

### Demographics

#### Physiology

**In medical school, we've learned a lot about Virchow's triad and the
etiology of venous thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold true
today?**

I think it does. There's a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think
the principle that the flow, the vessel wall, and the blood constituents
are the main factors that affect whether or not you get thrombosis in a
vein is still pretty solid. However, there is also a real change in
mindset about the whole idea of provoked and unprovoked DVT. Again, I
would urge people to look at some of the new areas that we've covered in
these guidelines.

#### Prevalence

Incidence of DVT increases with age by a factor of 1.9 per 10 years.

Of patients who develop DVT, 1% will have phlegmasia and 10% may develop
a pulmonary embolism.

For post-thrombotic syndrome, 17% will develop at 1 year and 29% by 8
years after the initial DVT. For recurrence, 30% will develop over 10
years but the highest risk for recurrence is in the first
year.[@beckman2010; @bulger2004; @meissner2007]

#### Etiology

**You mentioned there about potential risk factors for DVT, and that can
be classified into these provoked, which can be transient or persistent,
and then unprovoked risk factors. Can you talk about some of the
specific factors and causes?**

In general, what's been happening for several years is a recognition
that there are some DVTs that happened with a clear provoking
factor---a common major, transient, provoking factor is major surgery, 
for example. So a lot of DVT are caused with that clear
provoking factor, but there's an enormous population of people that
don't have a clear provoking factor at all, or have a minor factor that
may or may not have contributed.

So traditionally there's been a dichotomy between provoked and
unprovoked. If it's provoked, they get a limited period of
anticoagulation is unprovoked it's long-term anticoagulation. And certainly the last big
thrombosis guidelines was the ACCP guidelines, the American CHEST
guidelines, and that's what they suggested, but it's much more nuanced
than that.

What we've got to remember is that there are some provoked DVTs where
there's much higher risk, and those are there's some unprovoked DVTs,
which actually there may be other factors that you need to take into
account. So I think for those people that are interested in this area,
it's really important to get to the nitty-gritty. So, long-winded way of
answering your question. But here are some risk factors:

-   Major provokes

    -   Surgery

    -   Major trauma

-   Minor provoked

    -   Shorter periods of immobility - a few days sick in bed with the
        flu

    -   Contraceptive pill - depending on whether it was just started or
        the patient has been taking for two to three years

In the guideline document is a big, long list of other things where for
people to think about it and consider.

In this review we are discussing mostly lower extremity DVTs, however
catheter-associated DVTs are sometimes encountered on examinations. In
general the DVT is considered to be a result of the line. However,
management is treatment of the DVT with or without line removal. If the
line is functioning well and the patient requires the line for other
therapy, then simply treating the DVT with anticoagulation should be
sufficient.[@kearon2016; @kovacs2007] Treatment is similar in patients
with cancer.[@debourdeau2009]

Prevention is a key component to mitigating the impacts of DVT. One of
the more common risk stratification tools in the United States is the
Caprini risk assessment model.[@bahl2010] Patients identified to be high
risk according to the Caprini risk index require mechanical prophylaxis,
pharmacological prophylaxis and early ambulation.[@gould2012;
@laryea2013]

**In those patients where, after you've taken a thorough history,
there's no obvious provoking factors. Is there a role for screening for
occult malignancies and thrombophilias?**

For thrombophilia testing, the history of it is really interesting. When
they were first identified and our ability to screen them first became
available, there's a lot of excitement because people thought they were
going to be able to identify a clear cause for all of these unprovoked
DVTs. The reality is that at least 50% of them, there's no identifiable
thrombophilia. So what it almost certainly means is there's lots of
thrombophilias that we haven't yet identified, we can't test for. So it
hasn't really been the panacea in that regard. The other pragmatic
reality for the thrombophilias is that if we're going to be putting
people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the additional value of
testing for these things is really very minimal.

And the ones that are really important---the thrombosis history is so
stark that they normally smack you in the face. So I think it's
generally gone out of fashion. And again, there's only very specific
circumstances where we would suggest testing them:

1.  If you're going to be trying to stop anticoagulation, for some
    reason, the patients don't want to be on it, or if there's bleeding
    risks

2.  There's a clear family history. Then it might be worth excluding
    some of the more sinister thrombophilias.

Otherwise, certainly not a role for routine testing and similarly for
malignancy---for unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying
malignancy is somewhere between 6-10%. The studies that have looked at
an aggressive, thorough assessment process rather than a more selective
process, have picked up a few more cancers, but the additional cost in
terms of anxiety, additional investigations, et cetera, and no
demonstrable improvement in outcome has meant that the guidelines have
not recommended routine cancer screening beyond the appropriate, symptom driven age and
sex specific screening---PSA, breast assessments, colonoscopy, etc.

One unique situation is recurrent or migratory superficial vein
thrombosis, particularly in older patients, can be associated with an
underlying malignancy.[@litzendorf2011]

### Evaluation

**What is the algorithm for investigation?**

The most important part is the first component of the algorithm,
which is an assessment of the pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who
comes with a DVT, you can go through a validated tool. The most common
is the Wells probability score, which is a series of questions and give
you an indication as to whether a DVT is likely or unlikely.
[@tritschler2018]

If a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very
straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a
D-dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is effectively excluded. The guidelines
are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this won't reach
our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has been
diagnosed, so we don't appreciate the importance of the early stages. So
again, a quick plug for the guidelines, there's a very nice algorithm,
beautiful colors---I definitely recommend having a look.

On ultrasound, acute DVT is characterized by an enlarged vein with a
non-compressible lumen and hypoechoic thrombus. Chronic post-thrombotic scarring is
often contracted with echogenic appearance.[@yusof2019] For more
details, see \@ref(sec-venous).

### Management

#### Medical

**So the exact choice and duration of anticoagulation in the management
of a DVT is probably beyond the scope of this podcast, but on the whole
are DOACs preferred over vitamin K antagonists, such as Warfarin and
why?**

In a word, yes, lots and lots of studies, funded by big companies that
make DOACs, have been done and they've all shown fairly consistent
things. They've shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K
antagonists at preventing DVT. They have almost always a significantly
lower bleeding risk, but they've got this enormous added convenience of
not needing regular blood tests, not having this dietary limitations, and
the erratic control, et cetera. So the general direction of travel is
inexorably towards more and more use of DOACs.

A couple of other areas where DOACs have really shined: The tendency is
to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often indefinite
anticoagulation. A number of studies, both rivaroxaban and Apixaban have
looked at the effect of a lower dose of DOAC in these patients. So if
you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower dose, a
prophylactic dose, so 10mg of rivaroxaban or 2.5mg BID of Apixaban. The
results have been impressive because the prevention of recurrent VTE is
very good, the same as the therapeutic dose, but the bleeding risk is
much lower. So you've got this additional benefit of being able to give
an even load those with even lower bleeding risk.

And the real icing on the cake for the DOAC has been a few recent
studies that have been looking at cancer patients. Traditionally cancer
patients where low-molecular weight heparin only, not for
DOACs.[@kearon2016] But the Hokusai study[@raskob2018] and the
Caravaggio study[@agnelli2020] more recently have both looked at
Edoxaban and Apixaban in the context of cancer and have shown that
actually they're very effective. In addition, a recent meta-analysis
found that recurrence rates were lower with DOACs, but bleeding rates
were no different.[@dong2019; @rossel2019]

In almost all of the areas, DOACs are demonstrating their superiority.
The one very notable exception is antiphospholipid syndrome,
particularly triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty
nasty acquired thrombophilia where Warfarin is still the gold
standard.[@pengo2018]

**Patients with a proximal DVT, in the iliofemoral or the
femoropopliteal segment, is there a role for elastic compression in the
acute phase?**

Traditionally people have been a bit nervous about putting compression
on patients with acute DVT, concerns about causing propagation and
causing PEs. A very important study was the
ideal DVT study[@tencate-hoek2018], run by Dutch colleagues,
and a number of other additional studies more recently that have built
on the original IDEAL DVT study.[@schreurs2022]

The short answer to your question is that early compression is really
important. It's a really positive thing to do within 24 hours and it's
proper compression. It's not just the Ted stocking and see what happens.
It's 30 to 40 mmHg, so that in practice is a class two
stocking with a bandage on top. The benefits are that this reduces the early pain
and swelling of the DVT, but also interestingly, it reduces the risk of
post-thrombotic syndrome and post-thrombotic venous obstruction. So if you put compression on early, it reduces
the risk of them developing post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus
has been on clearing the vein and early thrombus removal and
thrombolysis and thrombectomy and all this sort of aggressive stuff. But
just by doing the compression, we can have at least part of the same
effect and we've just not been doing it. Very rarely do these patients
get proper compression.

So there is a big section in the ESVS guidelines about the role of
compression and algorithm as to when, how to use it, and how long do you
use it for. What we want to see now is the DVT pathways around the
country, around the world, updated and amended with this latest
guidance.[@kakkos2021]

##### Complications - Pulmonary Embolism

More and more vascular surgeons are becoming involved with Pulmonary
Embolism Response Teams (PERT) and so surgeons should be familiar with
the acute management of DVTs that progress to pulmonary embolism. The
majority of pulmonary embolisms simply require anticoagulation.

However, if a patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, such as develops
hypotension, then the patient should undergo systemic
thrombolysis.[@kearon2016] Contraindications to systemic thrombolysis
include:

-   Age \>75

-   Intracranial neoplasm

-   Intracranial/spinal surgery or trauma with the last 2 months

-   History of hemorrhagic stroke

-   Active bleeding or known bleeding disorder

-   Nonhemorrhagic stroke within the past 3 months.

Patients who do not immediately respond to systemic thrombolysis, are a
high risk of bleeding, or in shock that may cause death before
thrombolytics take effect, then catheter based thrombus removal may be
considered. This complex decision making is best made through the
previously mentioned PERT.[@xenos2019] Endovascular techniques include:

-   Thrombus fragmentation

-   Suction thrombectomy

-   Rotational embolectomy

-   Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis

There are very high risk procedures and complications include pulmonary
artery perforation, pericardial tamponade, cardiogenic shock,
hemaglobinuria or other hemorrhagic complications.

##### Complications - Post Thrombotic Syndrome

**One of the concerning complications of a DVT, particularly a proximal
DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Can you recap the symptoms of PTS
and how it's diagnosed?**

PTS is a fairly amorphous entity that includes a series of patient
symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein thrombosis.
That's deliberately very vague, because the condition is so variable. In
terms of diagnosing PTS, the official diagnostic tool is a score of five
or more on the Villalta scale. The Villalta score is another one of
these tools that have been developed for both making a diagnosis, but
also assessing progression of PTS.[@kahn2014; @villalta1994]

But in terms of sort of symptoms---people get swelling, heaviness, pain.
There is a very unique symptom, which is venous claudication, which is
almost pathonogmonic of post-thrombotic syndrome with venous outflow
obstruction. It's this pain which has a bursting tense quality in the
calf on exertion, which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot
longer than arterial claudication. So sometimes people will take half an
hour to get better and the leg has to be elevated. So that's venous
claudication and that's often the most disabling symptom. But of course,
people can develop the same clinical complications than you can with any
venous disease---skin changes, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg
ulceration, et cetera. Those are the summery of symptoms for PTS, seen
in up to 50% but probably closer to 25% of proximal DVT.

##### Complications - IVC Filters

**A quick question about IVC filters. As vascular surgeons, we sometimes
get asked about the appropriateness of inserting an IVC filter. When
would you consider one and how long can one stay in situ for?**

So short answer is I virtually never consider one, and if already in
situ, remove as soon as possible. Let's expand on this a little bit. So
the history of IVC filters is a painful story, particularly in the US,
super aggressive use of IVC filters, very few of them retrieved, lots of
IVC occlusions, and major lawsuits against big companies. The most
important factor in successful IVC filter retrieval is dwell time less
than 7 months. Type of filter, tilting or protruding struts are not
associated with failure. Adverse events have found to be as high as
2%.[@desai2017] That's led to a worldwide, reluctance to use IVC filter,
so now we may not be using them in some cases when we should be using
them. The traditional indications and reasons for using IVC filters
included weird and wonderful things like floating thrombus and other
factors.

The reality is the only real indication that we could come up with was
when there's a proximal DVT, and there's a clear contraindication to
anticoagulation. So if there's no anticoagulation, then the risk of
propagation and PE is reasonably high, so there is a strong case for a
temporary IVC filter. If a patient is anticoagulated, very rarely can
the case be made for an IVC filter. I don't want to go into nuanced
details---such as where somebody already had a PE there's right heart
strain, there may be some anatomical features that you're worried about,
their anticoagulant control is borderline---there might be specific
cases, but this is really very rare. Most people anticoagulated do not
need an IVC filter.

A rather challenging and unique patient would be a pregnant patient with
a DVT and placenta previa. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in
placenta previa and in addition, an infrarenal IVC filter is also
contraindicated, so she would require a suprarenal IVC
filter.[@bates2018; @deyoung2016; @harris2016]

In the setting of a thrombosed filter, a patient may require urgent
intervention if they develop phlegmasia. Suprarenal filter placement may
be useful during the procedure to prevent embolization. Removal of the
IVC filter is contraindicated unless all clot is cleared.[@sheth2015;
@teter2019]

#### Surgery

**So clot burden reduction techniques are a hot topic at the moment.
Before we talk about endovenous techniques, is there a role for surgical
venous thrombectomy? And when would you consider this?**

Open thrombectomy is part of the spectrum of early thrombus removal
techniques. It used to be very popular, a very satisfying technique---I
think I've done it three times. They've all been for the same sort of
indication, which is phlegmasia, severe limb threatening post DVT
change, and in a patient where they weren't candidates for thrombolysis. However, if you're with a patient where the leg
is threatened, you can't anticoagulate them, you can't thrombolize them.
Then in that case this is a sort of last ditch approach. But if that's
not the case, then almost always a catheter based approach is less
invasive and more acceptable.

In addition, most people have got more training. Trainees should read
some of the descriptions of open thrombectomy--- it's a very satisfying
technique, but it's quite involved. It involves finding and exposing the
common femoral, deep femoral and femoral veins, applying tight
compression around the lower leg to milk the clots out distally to
proximally. So the original descriptions are really interesting, but
really very rarely would we need to do that.[@comerota2019]

#### Endovascular

**So you've mentioned catheter directed techniques for clot burden
reduction. Some recent trials have challenged our thinking on the
appropriateness of these techniques, such as the ATTRACT and the CaVent
trial. What's your take on the current evidence?**

This is very controversial. The fundamental issue here is that the
trials that have been done almost certainly would not have included a
large number of people who would benefit from interventions in the
opinion of the investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is
unlikely, particularly in the US, where the ATTRACT trial was done, but
these people would have been randomized into the trial.

So the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective
of the population. You've excluded the people that benefit, so it's an
underestimate of the benefit of the technique. But if we look at trial
results ourselves, there is a modest benefit. In the CaVent trial, PTS
rate was reduced. The quality of life was less impressive, but the PTS
rate was reduced moderately.[@haig2016] And in the ATTRACT trial, when
they subgroup analyzed the iliofemoral DVT group, then there was a
reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTS.
So I think the numbers are something along the lines of, you'd have to
treat 10 people with thrombus removal to prevent one person developing
moderate to severe PTS.[@vedantham2017]

So then the discussion is are those numbers needed to treat appropriate
for intervention? Particularly when you then start to consider the
additional need for stenting and long-term surveillance, et cetera. So I think the
jury is very much out. You've got really stark, strong, firmly held
unshiftable views on both sides of the argument and what we need is a
bit of nuance. What we need is everyone accepts that some people benefit
let's all work together, try and work out, which people benefit. Let's
work on case selection.

**So we'll put you on the spot then, when would you offer thrombolysis?
Which patients would you offer it in and which circumstances would you
also stent?**

There's no role for thrombolysis in anything other than the iliofemoral
segment. So if it's infrainguinal, proximal DVT, even if its severely
symptomatic, the studies that actually you cause harm by attempting
early thrombus removal. That's the first important point.

Even if they have got severe symptoms, there's always a role for initial
conservative management, compression with elevation and a lot of these people
have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. If they don't, and
there's an honest discussion, and the bleeding risk is low then
potentially there is a role. But when there's a treatment with a
borderline benefit or the benefit is unclear, then I think what we've
gotta do pick low risk patients, so low bleeding risk. We've got to
choose teams and techniques with the highest risk of technical success.
And we've got to pick people where we think the benefit is greatest,
i.e. those that have the highest risk of PTS.

Whether or not you stent is very difficult. We had a case not so long
ago where we had a very nice result from early thrombus removal, we
stented, and the patients thrombosed again early and subsequently was
identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Obviously
there wasn't the opportunity in the time to make that diagnosis prior to
the decisions around the thrombus removal, so you end up stung and now
this patient has a stent and can be very difficult to open up again. The
advocates and the aggressive stenters would say, you can't leave a
significant stenosis after thrombus removal, otherwise they will
rethrombose. Whereas others will say, if we go back to the early
studies, like CaVent, very few, if any, people actually had stents, but
actually their results were still reasonable.

I think once you get on the roller coaster of thrombus removal, it's
very difficult not to then proceed also to stenting, if you see a
significant lesion, for example, at the May-Thurner point.[@wang2018;
@meissner2012; @rollo2017] Final comment, I'll make is that the use of
recanalization and stenting for chronic PTS is a very effective
technique. So another approach, if you're not sure, is to manage them
conservatively, but always have that up your sleeve, if they get
significant PTS at six months, no earlier, then we could potentially
consider recanalizing and stenting at that point.

**Following thrombolysis, what duration of anticoagulation is
required?**

So the whole point of anticoagulation after DVT is to reduce the risk of
propagation and pulmonary embolus, firstly, but also then to reduce the
risk of recurrent VTE. The aims don't really change if you thrombolyzed
or if you put a stent in. Some people used to say, I put a stent in,
we've treated the May-Thurner and that was the main cause of DVT, so we
can stop the anticoagulation. That's not the case. So it shouldn't
change and it shouldn't be any shorter if you've thrombolize and put a
stent in.

Now, whether it should be longer because you put a stent in that's
debatable. Some people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols
after stenting, but that's to do with the stent rather than the DVT. So
remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE
and to stop propagation of the current event.

## Phlegmasia

**Some patients may present with very profound, lower limb swelling.
Pain and cyanosis with a threat to viability of the limb. Can you
explain for us what phlegmasia is and an approach to treatment?**

There's two sorts phlegmasia that are described, but to be honest, I
don't think anybody has a detailed and robust understanding of what
these actually mean. Phelgmasia alba dolens is the [white
leg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+alba+dolens&client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALiCzsY3xqSSjZro2T2oiRHzVPLniGwqAQ:1665422481903&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj727ybltb6AhXJoWoFHe3xCsMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1121&bih=1148&dpr=1),
cerulea dolens is the [blue
leg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+cerulea+dolens&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjIicmcltb6AhURQUIHHV_iC8gQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Phlegmasia+cerulea+dolens&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BAgjECc6BAgAEEM6BggAEAUQHjoECAAQHjoGCAAQBxAeUNTtA1jNhgRg_JEEaAFwAHgBgAF0iAHEC5IBBDE2LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=lFREY8jvC5GCieoP38SvwAw&bih=1148&biw=1121&client=safari)
and the severe, form a phlegmasia. Theoretically, cerulea dolens has a
limb loss rate of 30-40%\--severe limb threat, compartment syndrome,
skin blistering, swelling, etc. The reality is that it's often
over-diagnosed, so you'll see a lot of people saying I did venous
thrombolysis for phlegmasia and it's just a big swollen engorged leg.

The reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of
venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get
this cycle of worsening pressure, leaking of fluid from the capillaries,
increasing pressure on the soft tissues. Then that starts to threaten
tissue perfusion and potentially if it's bad enough this will threaten
the actual arterial profusion of the leg as well. Presentation often
includes iliofemoral DVT with non-palpable pulses and loss of sensation
with out improvement on anticoagulation and elevation. Endovascular early thrombus 
removal  is the first line with fasciotomies, with open thrombectomy
as back up for salvage.[@erdoes2011; @thomas2019]

So that's the sort of most severe and extreme form. I don't think
anybody has confidently linked the anatomical findings and features of a
DVT to what the leg looks like. There was a patient I saw who literally
had every deep vein acutely thrombosed from the IVC down to both lower
legs and was almost asymptomatic. So we've got this very uncomfortable
lack of understanding between the symptoms and the clinical and
anatomical pattern of DVT.

## Deep Venous Obstruction

### Etiology

**So finally, let's move on to talk about the treatment of proximal deep
venous insufficiency, both obstruction and incompetence. What are the
common causes for deep venous obstruction? Thinking about
post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic obstructions.**

So again, the terminology is important. So it's venous outflow
obstruction. Obstruction implies that there's a physiological issue
causing the consequences. As opposed to occlusion, which is an
anatomical term. So venous outflow obstruction, is essentially anything
that reduces the ability of venous blood to escape the leg via deep
venous channels will cause an obstruction.

And again, going back to a bit of physiology. Poiseuille's Law talks
about the flow rate being proportional to the fourth power of the radius. So it's really
interesting. A question to ask is that if you've got a two centimeter
vein, how many, one centimeter veins would it take to carry the same
potential flow as a single two centimeter vein?

The long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to carry
the same amounts of potential flow as a single two centimeter vein. So
it doesn't take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on
flow. Of course, most of the time, you don't need that flow potential,
it's only an absolute extremes of circulatory stress that you'll need
that sort of potential, but it is interesting. And again, it also
challenges when people say there's great collaterals and that will be
enough. Well unless they're enormous, you need 16 of them to have the
same potential blood carrying capacity.

So in terms of the causes, the most common by far is post-thrombotic
disease. So when you've had a DVT, one of three things happens. If
you're lucky, the vein will recanalize completely. If you're unlucky, it
will obstruct completely. And if you're somewhere in between, you'll end
up with partial stenosis and obstruction. What's important is even if
the vein is open, what you almost always lose in the post-thrombotic
vein is venous compliance. It's not the same compliant vein that can
respond to demands and physiological need that you have, in a primary
non-scarred vein.

Other potential causes are a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, or
May-Thurner lesion. So the original paper, 1957, is very interesting
reading.[@may1957] There were a couple of Austrian pathologists who identified that a very
high proportion of people, particularly those had left-sided DVT had,
not only the overriding iliac artery causing compression, but they had a
secondary tight fibrosis in the iliac vein.[@nazzal2015] So it's not
just the compression because any one of us in a certain position we'll
have a squashed vein. It's the fact that there's a secondary
inflammatory fibrotic change, which is what's causing the obstruction.
So that's a true May-Thurner or non-thrombotic lesion.[@liddell2018;
@rollo2017]

The other big group of patients of course, is malignant lymph node or
retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow obstruction. For
example, a patient with a large retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma may be
involving the vena cava. In this case, these patients may require en
bloc resection of the IVC and reconstruction with ringed PTFE, sized off
the preoperative imaging.[@quinones-baldrich2012; @fiore2012] But in the
end, post-thrombotic by far was the most commonly diagnosed pathology.

### Evaluation

**We may see patients who come in with severe venous disease with skin
changes, for example. When would you consider imaging the proximal deep
veins in addition to infrainguinal superficial and deep veins of the leg
and what are the best modalities to do this?**

So we are really getting down to the importance of a detailed assessment
of the entire superficial and deep venous system. Every patient with
venous disease should have a whole leg infrainguinal duplex to start
with---that's deep and superficial veins. There's no real role for just
looking at superficial veins. So you need to understand the context. In
terms of if their obstructed or if they're refluxing. Again, remember
that, reflux on a duplex, yes, all we see is arrows going in certain
directions. But all reflux means is that after a calf augmentation
maneuver, there is some retrograde flow---in a superficial vein, more
than half a second and in a deep vein, more than one second. That's all
it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for 0.6 seconds
in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled as reflux for all the rest
of the time that superficial vein is doing the right job, it's returning
the blood to the heart. So just be wary of interpreting what these
arrows mean. For more, see \@ref(venous).

In terms of how that affects your decision-making---one approach is to
consider the overall burden of venous disease, such as those with venous
hypertension. And what I try and do is draw a pie chart and say, you got
venous hypertension, here are the different causes of your venous
disease---that might include superficial reflux, deep venous reflux,
deep venous obstruction, and other factors. You try and apply some
clinical judgment as to what the different factors are.

Now, even if they've got significant, deep venous reflux and superficial
venous reflux, there is still a role for treating superficial reflux in
most of these cases. I still come across colleagues and other people who
say, look, you shouldn't treat the superficial veins if there's deep
reflux. But all the studies---EVRA, ESCHAR\--have shown significant
benefits, even if there's deep flux.[@gohel2007; @gohel2018] So again,
the key message is treat the superficial reflux if it's there. However,
if the patient has isolated deep reflux then management is limited to
wound care and compression, often as high as 40-50mmHg. Some series have
found that 70-80% will heal.[@odonnell2014; @maleti2011]

Now, deep venous obstruction and looking for it is a different matter.
There are again, lots of approaches, some people are very aggressive
about evaluating the iliac veins---CTVs and IVUS on everybody. The
problem is if you get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose
and if you start to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all
gets very messy.

I think the sort of people that have clear signs and symptoms of
major venous outflow obstruction, particularly venous
claudication, history of previous DVT, really disproportionate venous
changes to the superficial and the infrainguinal imaging. Proximal
obstruction can present with atypical proximal varicose veins in the
mons pubis, perineum, buttock, high posterior/lateral thigh, abdominal
wall. These findings are 93% predictive of deep venous obstruction
proximal to the inguinal ligament.[@kurstjens2016] Those are the people
that I would image.

And on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes in the common
femoral vein that make you think there is a proximal problem,
particularly a loss of phasicity of flow then that's pretty concerning
for a significant venous outflow problem. In an unobstructed venous
system, the common femoral vein should really reflect the right hearts,
which has some phasicity. There should be transmission of that
respiratory phasicity. So if that isn't there, then you're thinking,
hang on, there's something interrupting that transmission, which is
almost always an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people I'd
image, but I wouldn't over image---because then you end up with a
headache and a problem---Should I treat or should I not treat?

**So you mentioned IVUS, what is intravascular ultrasound and what are
the particular benefits of using this technique over venography alone?**

IVUS is a 9F probe that is inserted into the vein
and it gives you a 360 degree view in B-mode ultrasound---traditionally
without color flow, just B mode---of the anatomical structures. What
it's very useful for is identifying venous anatomy, confluences,
identifying the size of veins, so it allows you to plan sizes of stents.
It really is an important adjunct to venography and other imaging
modalities. We did our first 30 or so cases of deep venous stenting
without IVUS and thought we were brilliant and IVUS was a waste of
money. And then we started using IVUS and realized I can't believe we
were doing this without. Once you start using it, you suddenly realize
that it's a really useful adjunct. Recommended oversizing for vein
stenting is 10-15% of largest diameter of adjacent vein.[@gloviczki2011;
@odonnell2014; @raju2002; @raju2010]

In terms of when you use it, in some parts of the world it's commonly
used for diagnostic purposes, but beware of the risk of over-diagnosis. 
More commonly, almost routinely, IVUS is used for therapeutic, particularly when we're
stenting deep veins to plan our landing zones. When CTA/MRA shows
compression, it must be confirmed with IVUS prior to treatment. IVUS has
far greater sensitivity and specificity and must show a cross-sectional
surface area reduction of greater than 50%.[@gagne2018; @forauer2002]

**You talked about over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of the
decision-making processes that you go through when you're assessing a
patient who has a deep venous obstruction?**

There are lots of patients that have this anatomical change, the number
of referrals I get from people who have done a CT and they've picked up
a problem. The most important thing is the clinical status and the
clinical picture. So have they got symptoms---go about right at the
beginning of the podcast---have they got symptoms? Have they got
complications? If they haven't got significant symptoms and they haven't
got significant complications then there's not really an indication for
treatments.

So leg swelling was initially, frequently pushed as, oh you're swelling
will get better, if we get rid of your obstruction. That's only the case
in probably less than 50% of patients. The reason for that is that, yes
the original etiology for the swelling may well have been venous, but
you almost always get a secondary lymphatic dysfunction when you've had
swelling, for whatever reason---whether it's heart failure, whether it's
venous, the lymphatic system gets damaged. And so even if you get rid of
the original cause, the lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the
swelling persists.

The symptoms are very important and in terms of complications, if
somebody has intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important
indications. But a bit of skin change, a bit of mild swelling, careful
case selection is very important for these procedures.

### Management

#### Endovascular

There is variability in the availability of stents for venous
obstruction. However, closed cell braided stents (i.e. the Wallstent)
have been around for many years and has the most data related to long
term durability.[@gagne2019] These stents have the least radial force at
the ends, so it is recommended to extent 1-2cm beyond the venous
obstruction. In cases of proximal iliac vein obstruction, this may
require extending into the IVC 1-2cm which may cross, or "jail" the
contralateral iliac vein. When jailed, the rate of DVT on that side has
been reported as high as 10%.[@murphy2017; @le2018]

**So following a deep venous recanalization and stenting, what
surveillance do you offer for these patients?**

Surveillance has been evolving. The first availability CE (UK version of
FDA) marked deep venous stents in the UK was around 2012. A few services
across the country really got started at a few centers in 2012, 2013.
Initially there was an early scan and then a scan maybe at six weeks and
three or six months down the line.

I think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems,
often develop them very early. So we are scanning these people the day
after the intervention---obviously there's intraoperative quality
control and venograms and scanning---but the day after the intervention
to ensure that there's no early thrombus problems. Then we scan a couple
of weeks after to make sure that there's nothing that's happened early,
because there's an opportunity to re-intervene, to balloon, to correct
any technical issues, at that point. After that point, it's usually six
weeks, three months, six months, and then annually thereafter.

So that's a sort of protocol that we have and in general, what we've
seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop them
relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the
patency rates are very good. In our center, the the chronic PTS stenting
primary patency rates at around three years are over 80%-85%. Of course,
there are some that have problems, but it's important to remember that,
even those that have thrombosed, they generally go back to the level of
symptoms they have prior to intervention. Which is very reassuring. The
last thing you want to do is to make people worse with a novel
intervention.

**And so what about your anticoagulation and antiplatelet regime for
these patients?**

There was a systematic review done a few years ago where all of the
published literature for deep venous stenting was reviewed and I think
the authors identified 28 different regimens for anticoagulation of the
stenting.[@notten2021] The honest answer is nobody knows, our approach
is to have low molecular weight heparin as the primary anticoagulant for
the initial two week period. And then at the two week point, they
undergo a stent. If there's no issues, they get transitioned to a DOAC.

In addition, the patients get six weeks of clopidogrel as an
anti-platelet. And again, the reason for that is that it's a foreign
material into the vein. Yes, the role of anti-platelets in prev enting
venous thrombosis is very limited but there has to be some platelet
related activity and platelet activation involved there. So it makes
logical sense to have some anti-platelet activity. Of course the
downside is that there's an increasing bleeding risk. These are the
constant tightropes that you're walking with these patients.

#### Surgery

**We've talked about endovascular and endovenous treatments, but is
there a role for open surgery in these patients?**

So in the iliac segment, very rarely. In some patients, you can do PTFE
reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations
of Palma-Dale[@palma1960] bypass and May-Husni[@shaydakov2015] type
procedures. They all sounded very elegant in the books, but the reality
is a great saphenous vein going across the lower abdomen to the other
side is not really going to sort the problem out in a durable way for
all sorts of obvious reasons---the size of the vein, the pressure and
all that sort of stuff. So there's really very limited role for those
sorts of procedures.

Now, the one area where there may be a role for open reconstruction is
in the common femoral vein. The consistent observation is that good
inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients.
And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then
it's very difficult to reconstruct that inflow endovascularly. So a
number of authors have advocated the use of endophlebectomy, opening up
the common femoral vein, and cutting out the scarring and the
tribulations, putting a patch on it. Sometimes even putting an AV
fistula---a little six millimeter graph from the common femoral artery
onto the vein to really drive the flow through the stent. It's a pretty
complicated operation and you can imagine you're dissecting down and
there's lots of little veins everywhere and lots of lymphatics. The
wound complication rate is very high.

So really very limited role only---the endovascular approach is really
the way forward for these patients.

## Pelvic Congestive Syndrome

### Presentation

**So finally, let's talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is
pelvic congestion syndrome and how does it present?**

So it often doesn't present anywhere near a vascular surgeon. There are
a number of women who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging
symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some association with
menses, there's often dyspareunia and a whole variety of other symptoms.

There may be associated vulvar varices or posterior buttock and thigh
varices all as a result of pelvic venous incompetence. But it's a
complicated field---there are some people that have pelvic symptoms,
there are some people that have the varicose veins or some will have a
combination of the two. Almost always they will be seen and initially
assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming to the vascular
surgeons.

### Evaluation and Management

**When we do see these patients, are there any treatment options
available for them? And when would you consider treating?**

**I**n a highly selective way---this is venous disease in a
nutshell---the association between anatomical changes and clinical
symptoms is ropey at best. In terms of postpartum women, an enormous
proportion of these women have got venous reflux in the pelvis---if you
look hard enough. so the problem is similar to that of
May-Thurner syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start
identifying these symptoms and then you lose the ability to really
discern who's going to benefit most.

So again, I would go back to clinical symptoms as the single most
important thing. If they've got severe clinical symptoms majorly
affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous
changes, then those people to try to intervene on. It's not necessarily
a benign procedure. Pelvic vein embolization involves implantation of
coils. There's concerns about non-targeted embolization as coils have ended
up in lungs. There are a number of people with unknown nickel allergies
that have problems with these coils. So again, it's not an area to be
over aggressive. So careful case selection is important. So again, a
quick plug for the ESVS guidelines. There is a very good section on
pelvic venous disease assessment.[@demaeseneer2022]

What's very important is again, to differentiate between pelvic
congestion syndrome and pelvic origin varicosities. One thing that is
certainly being advocated is that if the varicose veins are coming from
the pelvis, but there's no pelvic congestion syndrome, it's perfectly
reasonable just to deal with the visible varicosities from below---with
some foam sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being
super aggressive embolizing from above. But I think anybody who's
involved in managing this really needs to work closely with the
gynecologists. There are gynecological diagnoses that need excluding
before we start to address the venous disease. And there are a number of
validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably
quite important. So not for the faint-hearted.

## Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome

SVC syndrome is an acute presentation of head and neck venous congestion
often due to SVC obstruction. This can be intrinsic due to indwelling
devices or extrinsic due to malignancy or mediastinal fibrosis (half of
benign cases).[@kalra2019; @rice2006; @parish1981]

### Management

Angioplasty and stenting are first line treatment for benign
etiology.[@rizvi2008; @sheikh2005] Angioplasty alone may be
sufficient, but stenosis refractory to angioplasty may require stenting.
SVC syndrome with failed endovascular management in reasonable operative
candidates can undergo open reconstruction with large diameter
prosthetic graft or spiral vein graft.[@doty1999] However, restenosis in
open repair can be as high as 15%.[@kalra2018; @sfyroeras2017]

SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, bronchogenic or lymphoma, is often
most effectively treated with palliative radiotherapy with good
response.[@talapatra2016] Endovascular or open recannalization is often
reserved only for those with severe symptoms refractory to radiation or
chemotherapy.[@higdon2006] Lymphedema pumps can help with symptom
management as well.

## Venous Trauma

Iliac vein injury often able to be accessed by ligating the internal
iliac artery and mobilizing the common and external iliac artery.
Transection of iliacs should only be used as a last resort if this
fails. [@leeIliacVesselInjuries2002]

For more on venous trauma, see \@ref(abdominal-venous).

## Lymphedema

Here we will discuss lymphedema of the lower extremity. This is a broad
topic, but the management decisions are relatively straightfoward and
knowledge is required for examinations. For upper extremity lymphedema,
see \@ref(sec-upper-extremity-lymphedema).

### Demographics

#### Etiology

Lymphedema can be thought of as a primary dysfunction of the lymphatic
channels or the secondary result of a disease that results in the
destruction of lymphatic flow. Causes of secondary lymphedema include
filariasis, which is endemic to parts of South America.[@pfarr2009;
@shenoy2008]

#### Presentation

The management of lymphedema is determined primarily on its clinical
stage at presentation.[@grada2017] The staging for lymphedema is as
follows:

| Lymphedema Stage |        Description         | Symptoms                                                                 |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|---------------------------------------|
|        0         |        Sub-clinical        | No swelling, heaviness or discomfort                                     |
|        1         |    Sponteous Reversible    | Swelling improved with limb elevation                                    |
|        2         |  Spontaneous Irreversible  | Pitting and swelling, not improved with elevation                        |
|        3         | Lymphostatic elaphantiasis | Skin hardening, non-pitting edema, verrucas changes, recurrent infection |

### Evaluation

On physical exam, a classic finding is Stemmer's sign, which is a
thickened skin fold at the based of the second toe/finger. The sign is
positive when the tissue is hardened and cannot be lifted.[@rockson1998;
@rockson2019]

Lymphedema is most often diagnosed based on clinical presentation and
physical exam. Lymphoscintography can be used to confirm the diagnosis
in complex presentations and would demonstrate dermal back flow, absent
or delayed transport, crossover filling, absent or delayed visualization
of lymph beds.[@rockson2019; @odonnell2017]

### Management

Treatment is best initially managed with combined decongestive therapy
(CDT) which includes an intensive reductive phase (4-8wks), followed by
life long maintenance, often with specific compression
garments.[@grada2017] CDT in the setting of heart failure has been
reported to lead to volume overload.[@lawenda2009]

In extreme cases, after CDT therapy has been instituted for at least 6
months and the patient has persistent refractory symptoms, surgery may
be used for reconstruction or debulking.[@grada2017; @baumeister2016]
